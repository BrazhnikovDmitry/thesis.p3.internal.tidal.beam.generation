This chapter describes generation of the internal tidal beam in Tasman Sea and its properties in mid basin, mainly self interference/diffraction. This chapter consists of the following points:
1) Generation of IT beam occurs in presence of remote tidal signal which shapes conversion
2) The standing wave is the remote signal; its variability will define the beam.
3) Difference in the beam generation pattern will affect its mid-basin properties.
4) There is a transition from Fresnel to Fraunhofer diffraction zones.
