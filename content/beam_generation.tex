\section*{Abstract}
Variability in the conversion of barotropic tidal energy into internal tidal waves at the Macquarie 
Ridge is addressed by carrying out numerical experiments with variable hydrographic conditions. The 
main goal of the simulations is to compliment a field program, the Tasman TIdal Dissipation 
Experiment (TTIDE), which was designed to study the fate of radiated internal tides as 
they impinge on the Tasman continental slope located 1000 km to the west. The Macquarie Ridge 
and the nearby Campbell Plateau form a double-ridge system found here to be conducive to strong 
interference and complicated wave mechanics. The waves, emitted from the plateau couple 
with internal wave generation occurring at the ridge, and consequently drive amplification or 
reduction in the local conversion rates. 
The numerical experiments show that at the Macquarie Ridge energy transfer to mode-1 changes by 
$\pm 
10\%$ in magnitude and exhibits spatial variability. These modulations are inherently linked to the 
coupling with the nearby emitted waves. The remote wave properties are comprehensively examined by 
a 
novel technique for directional decomposition of the interfering wave fields. 
The 
result emphasizes non-plane wave propagation and the importance of multiple reflections on the 
wave amplitudes. It is shown that temporal variability stems from water mass redistribution 
attributed to dynamics of the local front. Additionally, 
local stratification modulates the reflectivity/transmission and hence, the degree of 
the amplification in the double-ridge system. Variable strength of the conversion leads to 
basin-scale changes to the wave 
field that can produce irregular signals in far-field observations and variable amounts 
of energy arriving at the Tasmanian slope.\\

\section{Introduction}
\label{C3.sec:intro}
Baroclinic tides originate from heaving of isopycnal surfaces driven by a strong 
barotropic flow across topographic relief. This process converts barotropic tidal 
energy into baroclinic motions \citep{hendershott1981long}, constitutes a 
third of the global budget for the lunar semidiurnal constituent \citep{egbert2000significant, 
munk1997once}, contributes significantly to internal wave climate \citep{wunsch1975deep} and 
interior ocean mixing \citep{wunsch2004vertical}. At most conversion sites, because of highly 
inclined slopes, the radiated 
internal waves of tidal period (internal tides) have vertical wavenumber spectrum dominated by 
highly stable low modes \citep{st2002role} able to transmit tidal energy over ocean basin-scale 
distances \citep{zhao2016global} with as yet unknown fate. While generation sites have been 
identified 
\citep{morozov1995semidiurnal, simmons2004internal, arbic2010concurrent} and some have been 
studied in detail, e.g. Hawaii Islands \citep{rudnick2003tides}, Luzon Strait 
\citep{alford2015formation}, Mendocino Escarpment \citep{althaus2003internal}, 
the Bay of Biscal 
\citep{gerkema2004internal}, and analytical models have been developed \citep{garrett2007internal}, 
there is still large uncertainty about variability in the conversion and its dynamics.\\

The analytical models of internal wave generation emphasize a ratio of the angle of internal wave 
characteristics to the bathymetric slope, known as slope's criticality, 
\citep{sutherland2010internal, 
garrett2007internal} along with a height of topography as primary quantities in setting conversion 
levels \citep{llewellyn2003tidal, petrelis2006tidal}. For tall, steeply inclined submarine ridges 
the energy transfer approaches an upper theoretical limit \citep{petrelis2006tidal, 
st2003generation} making them ``hotspots" of barotropic tide scattering and internal tide 
production \citep{morozov1995semidiurnal, egbert2000significant}. The amount of the converted 
energy is 
quantified as a correlation between the resultant baroclinic bottom pressure and the 
vertical component of the barotropic tidal current \citep{kurapov2003m, simmons2004internal}. 
Therefore, conversion  
represents work done by the 
barotropic tidal current in displacing the isopycnal interfaces (see Appendix \ref{C3.app:conv} for 
derivation). Clearly, stratification  
directly 
impacts the energy transfers \citep{holloway1999internal} with variability especially 
pronounced when water properties change near supercritical bottom gradients 
\citep{gerkema2004internal}.\\

Besides hydrographic conditions, temporal variability arises when nonlocal, baroclinic tidal signal 
couples  
with local generation processes \citep{Kelly2010a, zilberman2011incoherent, 
pickering2015structure}. The interaction affects not only the baroclinic pressure term, but also 
the 
timing 
of the baroclinic motions relative to the surface tide forcing. Moreover, the phase lag determines 
the sign of the energy transfer. For example, the conversion rate is negative if the downward 
barotropic current coincides with isopycnal heaving, and hence, the baroclinic wave 
loses 
energy by performing work against the external force imposed by the barotropic tide. In the 
opposite case of the in-phase coupling, an amplified energy transfer from the surface tide takes 
place. Examples of the coupling can be found in cases when opposite slopes of a single ridge 
affect each other \citep{zilberman2011incoherent, echeverri2010internal}, or there is spatially 
inhomogeneous distribution of internal tide generation \citep{osborne2011spatial, 
ponte2013coastal}, or when neighboring topographic features drastically alter the internal tide 
dynamics \citep{xing1998three, buijsman2012modeling, klymak2013parameterizing, buijsman2014three}. 
The present investigation considers similar processes at the Macquarie Ridge, south of New Zealand 
\fignmp{C3.fig:geo.map}, with emphasis on temporal and spatial variability of internal 
tide generation.\\

The Macquarie Ridge scatters barotropic energy into internal tidal waves; in the Tasman basin the 
waves constructively interfere \citep{rainville2010interference} and form a baroclinic tidal beam 
\citep{zhao2016global}. Its 
fate is a subject of a recent field program, TTIDE \citep{pinkel2015breaking}, and one of the goals 
of this study is to compliment the observations with numerical simulations. The beam generation is 
complicated because of the neighboring Campbell Plateau. It is possible, that similar to the 
double ridge geometry of Luzon Strait \citep{alford2011energy}, in-phase coupling can substantially 
amplify 
conversion of barotropic tide \citep{buijsman2012double, echeverri2010internal}. In turn, 
this can affect the magnitude of the beam and far-field observations.\\

Oceanographic conditions present additional complexity as the Macquarie Ridge is located in region 
of interaction 
between 
subtropical (STW) and subpolar (SAW) water masses \citep{chiswell2015physical}. 
The zone is bounded by two fronts delimited by surface isohalines of $35.1$ and $34.7$ psu
\citep{belkin1996southern, hamilton2006structure} \fignmp{C3.fig:geo.map}. The Southern 
Substropical Front 
(S-STF) defines the poleward extent of STW and has strong signature in the upper 100-200 m. The 
associated geostrophic current is weak because of strong density compensation 
\citep{graham2013dynamical}, but topographic 
steering by the ridge produces meanders of S-STF that can result in eddy shedding 
\citep{smith2013interaction}. Mesoscale variability is also induced by atmospheric cyclones and 
local winds that drive front filamentation \citep{james2002summer}. On synoptic scales, there is a 
possible 
migration of up to $1^{\circ}$ meridionally \citep{smith2017variability} in response to a seasonal 
cycle of 
insolation and strength of the westerlies.\\

The primary goal of this study is to describe the effect of the complex internal wave field on the 
generation of the tidal beam and how the dynamics evolves in response to the changing 
oceanographic conditions. These problems were investigated by means of regional numerical 
simulations that 
combine baroclinic tide dynamics and variable, realistic hydrographic conditions (Section 
\ref{C3.sec:model}). General 
characteristics of the generation are described in Section \ref{C3.sec:main_res}. The primary 
mechanism of 
amplification is identified, and its connection to the remote internal waves is established 
(Section \ref{C3.sec:amp_mech}) via the application of a novel decomposition technique (Appendix 
\ref{C3.app:ddec}). 
This allows for 
complete description of how generation is governed by a three-dimensional wave field, dependent 
upon 
the ocean state (Section \ref{C3.sec:3d_var}). To conclude, the effect of the discussed dynamical 
factors are related to the conversion levels and intensity of the tidal beam 
(Section \ref{C3.sec:disc}).\\

\section{Numerical experiments and analysis}
\subsection{Numerical experiments}
\label{C3.sec:model}
Numerical simulations were performed with Regional Ocean Modeling System 
\citep{shchepetkin2005regional} to study dynamics of internal tide generation around New Zealand, 
propagation in Tasman Sea and reflection by Tasmania. The domain covered the southern Tasman Sea 
from $60^{\circ}$ S to $35^{\circ}$ S, the zonal extent stretched from $142^{\circ}$ to 
$172^{\circ}$ E. The horizontal grid spacing was $1/32^{\circ}$ on average corresponding to 
discretization of 3 km 
in zonal direction and 2.5 km in meridional. The nonuniformly separated, vertical 50 $s$-levels 
were placed to smoothly follow subsurface terrain.\\
Such discretization of vertical momentum equation can induce artificial, horizontal  
along-slope flows \citep{haidvogel1999numerical} due to errors in reproducing of pressure 
gradient force. Especially severe errors are made by steep terrain. The misbehavior is usually 
resolved by artificial smoothing of topography. This procedure additionally increases numerical 
stability, but has an adverse effect on dynamics of internal tide \citep{di2006numerical} since 
its generation sites are collocated with large topographic gradients. To test the numerical 
setup, a sensitivity study was carried out by performing additional experiments with grid size of   
$1/8^{\circ},~1/16^{\circ},~1/64^{\circ}$. Essential for this study 
internal tide behavior manifested at $1/16^{\circ}$ and converged for $1/32^{\circ}$ and 
$1/64^{\circ}$ cases with no marked differences observed.\\

This work addresses the gravest baroclinic mode dynamics in the deep ocean. Spatial 
extent of 
waves is large compared to associated vertical displacements. This ensures linear regime of 
propagation without dispersive and nonhydrostatic effects taken place such as fission into 
solitons. A hydrostatic solver used in ROMS seems to be a proper choice for the simulations. Such 
simplification in wave dynamics was also assumed in previous studies \citep{carter2008energetics, 
merrifield2001generation,  merrifield2002model, kerry2013effects}. In more dynamically 
accurate   
simulations of \citep{kang2012energetics, zhang2011three} the nonhydrostatic effects were found to 
be important only for internal tide propagation in shallow water, while the gravest mode generation 
mostly followed linear dynamics with vertical accelerations to have negligible contribution.\\

\textbf{The horizontal boundary conditions were imposed to be open for depth-averaged, barotropic 
flows 
(modified Flather condition) and for surface elevation (ref Chapman). The three dimensional fields 
of currents and tracers were subject to mixed radiative-nudging conditions of 
\cite{marchesiello2001open} (with time scale of 3 days).} The baroclinic fields were  
nudged to zero by linearly increasing lateral viscosity and diffusivity over sponge layers. Through 
the same outer boundaries numerical simulations were forced with barotropic tide. The $M_2$ tidal 
currents and sea level were derived from TPXO atlas, version 7.2 \citep{egbert2002efficient} and 
prescibed as volume transports linearly interpolated onto the model's grid. This study considered 
only $M_2$ constituent since amplitude ratio with $S_2$ is 4-to-1 suggestive of 
slight open-ocean 
spring-neap modulation. The diurnal species are weak in the region except shoals east of New 
Zealand \citep{walters2001ocean}.\\

Several ocean states were prescribed and analyzed separately to investigate variations of 
baroclinic tide dynamics. In the \sqm{uniform}-case setting lateral gradients in water properties 
were 
absent, 
while buoyancy frequency was set to be representative of the Tasman Basin. The second type of 
simulations was performed to investigate interannual and interseasonal variability (Table 1). The 
third calculation was intended to cover whole period of TTIDE/TBEAM/Tshelf field programs 
\citep{pinkel2015breaking}.

\end{table}
The simulations with variable conditions were at first initialized with HYCOM hindcasts
\footnote{(NAVGEM;	downloaded from hycom.org)} for respective start dates. Then during 
integration, 
along with barotropic tidal flow, time-variable, subtidal fields 
of horizontal currents, temperature and salinity were imposed along the 
boundaries. Air-sea interaction was simulated by utilizing MERRA-reanalysis 
\citep{rienecker2011merra} to prescribe realistic fluxes of heat, moisture and momentum.

\subsection{Internal tide analysis}
\label{C3.sec:anlsys}
Most of the simulations proceeded for 15 days \tblnm{ch2:table_exp}. In all 
cases the first 10 days were regarded as spin up period that allowed a single 
passage of mode-1 internal tide from New Zealand to Tasmania that takes roughly 7 days. After the 
spin-up period three 
dimensional fields of velocity, temperature and salinity were sampled hourly over 5 days. And in 
the TTIDE-experiment the quantities were subsampled with 5 day window, hence, naming convention 
\tblnm{ch2:table_exp}. Then the time series high pass filtered with Butterworth filter 
of 
order $6$ with cut-off frequency of $1/36~cph$ to remove subtidal motions. The filtered signal was 
further fit in a least square sense to $M2$ harmonic. Then the three dimensional field of 
horizontal currents underwent a separation into barotropic and baroclinic signals using following 
decomposition \citep{cummins1997simulation, kunze2002internal, carter2008energetics}
\begin{equation}
\label{ch2:bt_bc_vel}
\vec{u}_{bt}(x,y) = \frac{1}{H} \int_{-H}^{0} \vec{u}(x,y,z)  dz,~\vec{u}_{bc}(x,y,z) =  
\vec{u}(x,y,z) - \vec{u}_{bt}(x,y)
\end{equation}
Pressure associated with internal tidal motions was found from density field via the  
hydrostatic approximation and the same decomposition \citep{kunze2002internal, kelly2010topo},
\begin{equation}
\label{ch2:bt_bc_pres}
p(x,y,z) = \int_{-z}^{0} \rho(x,y,z) g dz,~p_{bc}(x,y) = p(x,y,z) - \frac{1}{H} \int_{-H(x,y)}^{0} 
p(x,y,z) dz
\end{equation}
In the both expressions rigid-lid approximation is used. This is a valid assumption unless 
vertical accelerations are greater than acceleration due to gravity \citep{kelly2010topo}.\\
Each variable was then decomposed into vertical normal modes. The eigenfunctions were obtained by 
solving Sturm-Liouville problem under the hydrostatic approximation,
\begin{equation}
\label{C3.eq:sturm}
\frac{d}{dz}\Big( \frac{1}{N^2(z)}  \frac{d \psi(z)}{dz}\Big) + c^{-2}_n \psi(z) 
= 0
\end{equation}
where $c_n$ is the mode phase speed in non-rotating ocean, $N^2$ - local Brunt-Vaisala 
frequency profiles found from time-averaged density fields.\\
This work focuses on energy characteristics of the low mode internal tidal wave field. 
Period-averaged rates of conversion from barotropic tide to 
baroclinic \citep{simmons2004internal, kurapov2003m}, depth-averaged energy flux, horizontal 
kinetic energy (HKE) and available potential energy (APE) are found as
\begin{align}
\label{C3.eq:conv}
C_{bt\to 1} = -\frac{1}{2}(\cj{\vec{u}_{bt}} \cdot \nabla H) p_{1}|_{z = -H(x,y)}\\
\vec{F} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{H} \cj{\vec{u}_1} p_1 \int_{-H}^{0} \psi_1(z) \psi_1(z) dz\\
HKE = \frac{1}{4} \rho_0 \cj{\vec{u}_1} \vec{u}_1 \int_{-H}^{0} \psi_1(z) \psi_1(z) dz\\
APE = \frac{1}{4c_1^2} \rho_0 \cj{p_1} {p}_1 \int_{-H}^{0} \psi_1(z) \psi_1(z) dz
\end{align}
Here the subscript $1$ identifies the first eigenmode, all variables are given in complex number 
notation with the complex conjugate defined by $\cj{}$. The coefficient $\frac{1}{2}$ appears due 
to 
time 
averaging.\\

The mode-1 internal tide fields were additionally subject to directional analysis in order to 
extract elemental signals usually hindered by interference. The details are presented in appendix 
\ref{C3.app:A1} and summarized as follows. Dynamical fields of pressure and currents sampled over 
area-limited footprint can be described by directional 
spectra. Its circular Fourier 
transform was then obtained as solution by damped least squares of an ill-posed inverse problem. 
The 
spectral, directional analysis differs from the approach of \cite{zhao2010long} for two main 
reasons. The used here technique seeks for continuous distribution of 
energy over all compass directions, rather than a finite number of plane waves. This makes a 
difference in regions 
where wave diffraction prevails. For instance, wave field near sites of internal tide generation or 
scattering will be comprised by angular distribution of energy confined to diffractive lobes 
\citep[e.g.,][]{munroe2005topographic, johnston2003internal}. On 
the other hand, because of finite-window sampling artificial lobes are introduced as in classical 
Fourier analysis. The analysis artifacts lead to unambiguous interpretation, so judgment should be 
used when wave fields are back-synthesized over sampling angular sectors. Secondary, 
velocity measurements are utilized along with pressure observations \eqref{C1:uv.eq}. The 
formulation provides additional constrain on the inverse model. Indeed, the velocity equations tend 
to lessen Gibbs phenomena. Furthermore, the directional spectra technique can be extended 
point-wise observations where currents and pressure are measured simultaneously  \footnote{such as 
a stationary mooring}.\\

\textbf{Get rid of it? - Define what you mean by average and stdev}\\
All of the above calculations produced sets of dynamical variables for barotropic, baroclinic 
fields and directional representation of the gravest mode for each experiment. To study 
variability in the generation, mean energy characteristics were defined by simple arithmetic mean 
(ensemble-mean) and variability - by standard deviation. Such definitions have a caveat. 
While ensemble-mean allows a straightforward interpretation of mode-1 dynamics, it 
incorporates  
a portion of variable (non-stationary) signal since any energy characteristic is a nonlinear 
quantity \citep{zaron2014time}. On contrary, energy flux, for instance, found from ensemble-mean 
pressure and currents exclusively provides a stationary part. However, if a mode-decomposed signal 
is considered, finding the means entails averaging of vertical basis functions. As a 
consequence, their orthogonality is not preserved leading to uncertainty in the dynamics. 
Performed comparison (not shown) between an ensemble-mean of flux and a flux of ensemble-means did 
not reveal significant differences in spatial structure, though the latter results were smaller.

\section{Results}
\label{C3.sec:main_res}
\subsection{Internal tide generation at the Macquarie Ridge}
The semidiurnal barotropic tide propagates into the Southern Tasman Sea from the North 
\fignmp{C3.fig:BT}. Its phase increases in a counterclockwise manner with maximum amplitude of sea 
level located along New Zealand's coast, consistent with Kelvin wave dynamics in the Southern 
Hemisphere \citep{walters2001ocean}. The simulated sea surface tidal oscillation closely followed 
TPXO7.2 with 
gross 
features well captured, but the sea level amplitude and cotidal (phase) lines exhibited wave-like, 
small scale perturbations. This is a typical manifestation of low-mode baroclinic waves 
\citep{niwa2004three}. The baroclinic tidal fluxes \fignmp{C3.fig:beam} revealed complicated wave 
field structure resulted from 
multiple generation sites determined by steep topographic relief. The primary sites were located  
just south of New Zealand as flow of the barotropic Kelvin wave interacted with relief of the 
Macquarie Ridge. As a result, several low-mode beams \citep{rainville2010interference} were emitted 
into the Tasman 
sea. Henceforth, analysis focuses on the most energetic beam that originated from a site centered 
at 
$49.5^{\circ}S$ (inset on \fignm{C3.fig:geo.map}), hereafter referred to as the Macquarie 
Ridge.\\

The major beam was mainly generated on highly supercritical slopes where kinetic energy of the 
barotropic tidal currents was converted into available potential energy of the internal tidal 
waves \fignmlp[C3.fig:gen]{A}. The energy transfer into mode-1 baroclinic tide was found to be $1.7 
\pm 0.2~GW$. 
This is half the amount found at Kaena Ridge, Hawaii \citep{carter2008energetics} and one tenth of 
that at Luzon Strait \citep{alford2011energy, kerry2014impact}. Further, relief of 
the Macquarie Ridge suggests that the strongest generation should be at the southern portion of the 
ridge where flanks of a seamount has steep slopes and average criticality of 2.25. The rest of the 
ridge consists of a gap and another seamount \fignmlp[C3.fig:geo.map]{inset}, both 
having more gradual slopes with criticality of 1.8. Contrary to the expectations, 
the conversion rates \fignmlp[C3.fig:gen]{B, C} revealed the gap contribution was significant and 
at times the largest. The temporal variability was unusually high with the conversion hot spot 
migrating from south to north and vice versa.\\

The Macquarie ridge features complex internal tide mechanics that were manifested as 
regions of negative conversion (green shading, \fignml[C3.fig:gen]{B}). Such reverse energy 
transfer and destruction of internal tide is driven by coupling with non-local baroclinic waves 
\citep{Kelly2010a}. The adjacent slopes of the Campbell Plateau (Auckland Escarpment) provided 
a source for such remote signal. Further superposition with the 
ridge-emitted waves created a standing wave \fignmlp[C3.fig:stand_wave]{A}. The wave presence was 
evident in the distribution of HKE marked by a node in the middle of Solander Trough. Additionally, 
around the node, energy flux formed a circular pattern \fignmp{C3.fig:stand_wave} with 
counterclockwise progression since the Coriolis parameter is negative in the Southern Hemisphere. 
A similar interference pattern was observed and modeled by \cite{buijsman2014three} in Luzon 
Strait where topography forms a double-ridge system with amplified levels of conversion 
\citep{buijsman2012double, klymak2013parameterizing}.\\

Further insights were obtained from the directional decomposition that separated the 
standing wave into east- and westward traveling components \fignmlp[C3.fig:stand_wave]{B, C}. On 
the eastern side of the Macquarie Ridge generation took 
place at the same seamounts. On slopes of the escarpment the conversion had complicated  
distribution of positive and negative sign manifesting complicated structure of energy transfers. 
This is partly result of more complicated sea bottom relief and the barotropic forcing 
\fignmlp[C3.fig:BT]{A, B}. Dynamically, as the ridge-emitted waves were 
back-reflected from the plateau, they interfered with the local generation 
resulting in the 
negative conversion.\\

Respective energy transfers across the trough were quantified and compared with spatially 
integrated conversion rates \fignmlp[C3.fig:stand_wave]{D}. On average, each directional component 
was almost equally divided amongst waves reflected from the supercritical slopes and wave energy 
converted from the barotropic field. At times the system exhibited large departures from the 
average state due to variable conditions of the coupling on the trough's slopes.\\

It is apparent that the coupling between tidal forcing at the ridge and reflected 
from the plateau internal waves represents a key mechanism driving variability of the 
conversion \fignmlp[C3.fig:gen]{C}. The associated energy transfers are examined along a 
two-dimensional transect (horizontal line on \fignml[C3.fig:gen]{B}) for 
experiment \sqm{2014} when conversion in the gap was the weakest. \sqm{2014} is contrasted with 
experiment \sqm{d10-15} to characterize what appears to be a normal situation at the Macquarie 
Ridge.

\subsection{Spatial and temporal variability in conversion}
\subsubsection{Coupling of local generation with remote waves}
\label{C3.sec:amp_mech}
The experiments, \sqm{2014} and \sqm{d10-d15} serve to illustrate a number of pathways that the 
energy transfer can take. \fignm{C3.fig:gen_2d} depicts respective wave field 
developments on panels A-D throughout ebb stage of the $M_2$ tidal cycle; E-F shows respective time 
series of the conversion at two designated locations on opposite slopes of the ridge. At 
ebb, on the ridge's western side \fignmlp[C3.fig:gen_2d]{A, C}, the downward barotropic current 
forced near the bottom isopycnals to dip. At hour 6 of the tidal cycle, in both experiments the 
energy was 
transferred 
from 
the barotropic tide into the baroclinic waves as the conversion was positive 
\fignmlp[C3.fig:gen_2d]{E}. However, in \sqm{2014}, at about hour 7, the 
transfer became negative as, contrary to the forcing, isopycnals began to rise. The ensued  
positive displacements were clearly seen at the moment of slack current \fignmlp[C3.fig:gen_2d]{B}. 
As the 
barotropic current reversed direction, the conversion again changed sign. Not surprisingly, the 
period-averaged energy transfer was weak \fignmlp[C3.fig:gen_2d]{G}. Experiment \sqm{d10-15} 
revealed another regime. Throughout the ebb flow the conversion rate was much larger and positive 
because the isopycnals were continuously depressed.\\

A striking difference originated from dynamics of the remote internal waves. During the ebb flow 
in \sqm{d10-15} a mode-1 wave originated at the Campbell Plateau and progressed across 
the ridge, 
evident by a characteristic vertical dipole pattern in the baroclinic pressure. The wave 
travel forced downward isopycnal motion along both slopes of the ridge \fignmlp[C3.fig:gen_2d]{C}. 
On the western side, the 
interaction was in-phase with the barotropic current, driving the strongly positive energy 
transfer. On the eastern side, there was upward isopycnal motion, so the transfer was negative 
\fignmlp[C3.fig:gen_2d]{F}, corresponding to energy loss from the remote wave. As a consequence, 
the 
conversion time series on opposite sides of the gap \fignml[C3.fig:gen_2d]{E, F} are almost 
reversed one to another, and the small shift between the two curves accounts for the remote wave 
transition.
In contrast, the 
mode-1 wave was not observed on the ridge slopes in \sqm{2014}. Here the eastern side exhibited 
positive 
conversion that led to internal wave radiation from the ridge crest \fignmlp[C3.fig:gen_2d]{A} seen 
as positive displacements obliquely propagating away from the topography. 
Probably, the previously mentioned rising of the isopycnals on the western side  
in the middle of the ebb flow in \sqm{2014} resulted from propagation of the 
radiated internal wave. It destructively interfered with the generation on the western side 
leading to the weak conversion.\\

It should be noted that the remote mode-1 wave was present in Solanders Trough 
($165^{\circ} - 165.5^{\circ}$) in both experiments, but its propagation was different since in 
\sqm{2014} the wave did not cross the gap. This result is further illustrated by the directional 
decomposition and deduced wave phase distributions \fignmp{C3.fig:2d_phase}. It is seen as 
the trough was occupied 
by a standing wave pattern, i.e. almost constant phase and hence, no propagation of the total 
signal. 
Near the Campbell Plateau ($165.5^{\circ}$) the decomposition revealed almost equal contribution 
of the east and west-traveling waves. However, at the ridge in \sqm{d10-15} the total signal 
propagated across the ridge with the westward component to be dominant. In \sqm{2014} 
the eastward wave was stronger and the phase tended to $-180^{\circ}$ (relative to phase of the  
surface tide on the western side) implying in-phase relation with the local barotropic tide and 
local generation. These results are consistent with the previous discussion. The two 
dimensional section can not explain the difference in the reported conversion, because 
the westward wave near the ridge had similar phase in the experiments and the phase lags can not 
result in the different sign of the energy transfer on the eastern side of the gap.\\

\subsection{Variability of the wave fields in Solanders Trough}
\label{C3.sec:3d_var}
In this section more detailed analysis of the directional decomposition was 
undertaken to address characteristic of the waves in Solanders Trough. These results are summarized 
on 
\fignm{C3.fig:wv_fld_dist} for the previously considered 
experiments and one added. The experiment \sqm{d35-40} manifested the nonstationary 
character of the conversion process at the Macquarie Ridge as the energy transfer increased from 
1.6 GW to 1.9 GW in a three week period \fignmlp[C3.fig:gen]{D}. The panels on 
\fignm{C3.fig:wv_fld_dist} 
provide energy flux vectors, and lines of constant phase are plotted to show travel times and  
wavefronts. For example, on the upper panels isoline of $-90^{\circ}$ is marked by red color. If 
the 
waves arrived to the gap earlier, then they would be in-phase with the surface tide on the eastern 
slope. But in all three experiments the arrival 
happened later in the tidal cycle, and hence, there were regions of the negative conversion except 
\sqm{2014}. Here, small flux vectors emphasized almost negligible transmission 
of the waves across the gap. This presentation reaffirms the previous section. But an 
additional comment can be made. Comparison of the $-90^{\circ}$-isoline between \sqm{d10-15} and 
\sqm{d35-40} revealed a phase difference of $15^{\circ}$ or $\sim30~min$ near the gap. The westward 
wave in the latter experiment arrived slightly earlier to the gap, and on the western slope of the 
ridge the consequent interaction with the local barotropic current was more in-phase resulting in 
the stronger barotropic energy conversion.\\

Energy flux direction along with wavefronts of the westward wave on 
\fignml[C3.fig:wv_fld_dist]{A-C} illustrate differences in structure of the wave field. This is 
primarily seen in the northern part of Solanders Trough (lower of $-49^{\circ}$ latitude). 
Experiment 
\sqm{2014} showed mainly zonal wave propagation, whereas in the other experiments the wave field  
had also southward component. Consequently, the wave progression was affected by topographic 
refraction on slopes of the northern seamount and the waves were steered towards the gap. Amplitude 
of the southward component was dependent on the interactions taken place on the Campbell Plateau. 
Such that, the predominantly zonal propagation in \sqm{2014} was caused by internal 
tide 
destruction at $(166.5^{\circ}E, 48.75^{\circ}S)$, \fignmlp[C3.fig:wv_fld_dist]{A, blue box} where 
slopes of the plateau have oblique orientation. Within the region it was lost 0.14 GW in 
\sqm{2014}, 0.07 - \sqm{d10-15}, 0.13 - \sqm{d35-40} during reflection of the eastward waves. Along 
with the weak incident wave \fignmlp[C3.fig:wv_fld_dist]{D} in \sqm{2014}, the strong internal tide 
destruction suppressed the southward component of the westward waves.\\

Reason for the different energy loss stemmed from variable propagation speed which is displayed by 
shading on \fignml[C3.fig:wv_fld_dist]{D-F}. Here the phases are now referenced to the barotropic 
tide inside the blue box, and the red line marks $90^{\circ}$-isoline. In the given experiments 
the eastward waves were out of phase with the local surface tide at the reference point, and the 
conversion was negative. Additionally, in \sqm{2014} the wave propagation was slower as the 
oceanographic conditions promoted small phase speeds. The resultant phase lag was about 
$130^{\circ}$. For comparison, in \sqm{d10-15} 
the impinging eastward waves had lag of $115^{\circ}$ and \sqm{d35-40} - $125^{\circ}$. This 
is consistent with the reported levels of the energy loss. Furthermore, the wave speed anomaly 
explained weak generation of the eastward waves on the eastern side of the northern seamount  
\fignmlp[C3.fig:wv_fld_dist]{A, $(165^{\circ}, -49^{\circ})$}, since arrival of the westward waves 
was delayed in \sqm{2014} \fignmlp[C3.fig:wv_fld_dist]{A-C, position of $-150^{\circ}$-isoline}. 
Though, in general, the westward waves were less dependent on the phase speeds. This point is 
explained next.\\

It is necessary to emphasize differences in character of the wavefronts and wave travel. As the 
westward 
wave originated from multiple sites on slopes of the Campbell Plateau, it exhibited non plane 
propagation seen as change in 
curvature of the phase lines. For example, consider progression from $-200^{\circ}$ to 
$-250^{\circ}$ on \fignml[C3.fig:wv_fld_dist]{A}. Such peculiarity furnished less dependence on 
wave speeds and oceanographic conditions. Contrary, phase lines of the eastward waves were 
reminiscent of the emitting 
topography of the seamounts and were approximately constant in their shape. So that, phase growth 
was strongly dependent on ocean conditions, since for plane waves phase increases as  
$~\frac{1}{c_p}$. This distinction in the wave propagation is also 
demonstrated by \fignm{C3.fig:2d_phase}. Here the eastward waves in the two experiments clearly 
marked different phase speeds, but this was not true for the westward waves that showed same 
growth.\\

Phase speed of internal tide is determined by local water column properties and stratification 
\eqref{C3.eq:sturm} such that the strongly stratified waters result in the faster wave travel. This 
dependence is further examined to explain the phase speed anomalies and their relation to 
variability of hydrographic conditions \fignmp{C3.fig:ocean_cond}. For the region of the Macquarie 
Ridge sea surface salinity serves to distinct warmer subtropical waters (STW is seen by brighter 
colors on the figure) and fresher subantarctic waters (SAW - colder color), and the surface 
expression is well representative of the upper water column density structure and strength of 
stratification. As consequence, there was a strong correspondence between water mass surface 
signature and phase speed anomalies (compare \fignm{C3.fig:wv_fld_dist} and 
\fignmp{C3.fig:ocean_cond}). For 
example, the experiments \sqm{d10-15} and \sqm{d35-40} showed development of a frontal filament 
after passage of an atmospheric cyclone \fignmlp[C3.fig:ocean_cond]{B, C}. The advected STW forced 
stronger pycnocline in the upper 200 m \fignmlp[C3.fig:ocean_cond]{lower panels, blue and green 
	lines} and led to the positive phase speed anomaly in \sqm{d35-40}. These examples suggest that 
strong presence of STW produce positive anomalies, while opposite is true for SAW. 
However, it is also worth considering conditions of \sqm{2014} when the water properties were 
characterized as a mixture of SAW and STW. The stratification was strongly surface intensified, but 
weaker deeper in the column.\\

\section{Interpretation of variability in the conversion and the standing wave}
The above analysis highlighted complicated and variable internal tide dynamics occurring at the 
Macquarie Ridge, in Solanders Trough and on slopes of the Campbell Plateau. The examined numerical 
simulations demonstrated how the plateau-emitted waves were modified by changing hydrographic 
conditions and how these processes were translated into variable generation of the Tasman Sea 
internal tidal beam. In the next section these insights are used to describe all the results with a 
goal to form more concrete understanding of internal tide variability at the Macquarie Ridge.

\subsection{Spatial and temporal variability in conversion}
\label{C3.sec:spat_conv}
The coupling of remote waves with local generation is addressed first due to its key relevance in 
setting magnitude of the energy transfer at the Macquarie Ridge. Obviously, amount of the remote 
wave energy reaching the western slopes of the ridge is a defining quantity that depends on 
transmission 
across the ridge's topography. The latter is addressed by Figure ... demonstrating spatial 
inhomogeneity of 
the eastern slope reflectance. \footnote{It was obtained by spatial averaging of criticality of 
	slopes 
	for which it was at least 0.7.} It follows that the remote energy was mainly transmitted 
	through 
the 
gap, while the seamounts were highly reflective. The spatial inhomogeneity of the transmission, 
hence, explains large contribution of the gap to the overall conversion of the Macquarie Ridge.\\

The relief of the topography also has signature on relative importance of the remote waves to the 
conversion variability. This is particularly manifested in how much each physical term in 
\eqref{C3.eq:conv} contributes to the variability. In order to do so, the equation is 
differentiated with respect to each term, and the differentials are substituted with variances 
\citep{kerry2014impact}. Results are given by \fignmp{C3.fig:var_sp} and are discussed in relation 
to the western slope. Here it is notable that the total 
variance found as sum of the individual contributions is equal to 0.9 GW, which was  
much larger previously reported 0.2 GW (Section \ref{C3.sec:main_res}). The disparity resulted 
from statistical dependence of the terms and hence, large non-zero covariance that has to be 
accounted in the sum. Nevertheless, the obtained distribution on the western slope 
shows a pattern that is set by spatially inhomogeneous transmission across the ridge. 
That is, variability due to the phase lag concentrated near the gap, but it was smaller over the 
seamounts, while opposite distribution held for amplitude of the bottom pressure. 
Physically, since on the western slopes of the gap the remote waves were largest than anywhere else 
on the ridge, they strongly impacted local generation. Both amplitude and phase of the bottom 
baroclinic pressure were perturbed and led to high 
temporal variability. On the 
steeper flanks of the seamounts the local generation was strong, while the remote waves were 
weak, so the coupling mainly affected the pressure's amplitude. Similar observation is made for the 
Campbell Plateau, though most of variability was dictated by phase of the impinging eastward 
waves.\\

\textbf{Temporal}\fignm{C3.fig:ener_var} time series of the conversion are plotted along 
with parameters of the remote waves to depict time variable interplay 
within the double-ridge system. Following the previous discussion, processes panel B focuses on the 
gap alone. However, it is worth emphasizing how the total conversion at the Macquarie Ridge 
was strongly modulated by the conversion in the gap. Correlation between the 
two was $R^2 = 0.75$. Further, the primary factor to cause this variability was variable amplitude 
of the westward wave in Solanders Trough, especially for the gap region 
\fignmlp[C3.fig:ener_var]{B} due to higher transmission. Here, magnitude of the conversion on the 
western side was correlated by $R^2 = 0.5\%$ to strength of the remote waves on the eastern side. 
The coefficient was substantially higher and rose to $0.8$ if \sqm{uniform} was omitted.\\

\subsection{Stratification effects}
Purple insets on \fignm{C3.fig:ener_var} present transmission coefficients 
obtained from the directional decomposition (purple filled dots). These estimates support the 
analysis based on 
criticality of the eastern slopes, so the gap alone transmitted $47 \pm 8~\%$, the two seamounts 
combined - , the Macquarie ridge overall 
- $35 \pm 4~\%$. In addition, these results were compared to a closed-form solution of 
\citep{larsen1969internal} for transmission by a single knife-edge. The Macquarie Ridge was thought 
as a two-dimensional barrier with height variable in response to changing oceanographic conditions. 
The height 
was found from the topography's mean depth in WKB-scaled vertical coordinate 
\citep{althaus2003internal} relative to Solanders Trough. Since the WKB-scaling depends on local 
stratification, such approach provides a perspective on influence of 
oceanographic conditions. The scaled analytical calculations are given by empty purple diamonds on 
\fignm{C3.fig:ener_var}.\\

Both calculations of the transmission coefficient reveal similar character of change. Hence, the 
local stratification does not only affect kinematic properties of the internal tides in Solanders 
Trough (\ref{C3.sec:3d_var}), but also influences dynamical properties of the double-ridge system. 
In particular, the oceanographic conditions modulate how much of the plateau-emitted energy will 
reach the conversion sites on the western slopes. On the other hand, the five- or ten-fold 
differences illustrate phenomena of increased transmission in a double-ridge system that depends 
on ridge separation distance or phase of the impinging waves. This phenomena was previously 
identified by \citep{klymak2013parameterizing} in relation to Luzon Strait.\\

Direct effect of variable stratification on the conversion has also to be considered since it is 
expected that strongly stratified ocean promotes higher shedding of internal tides 
\citep{holloway1999internal}. This dependence is again investigated by application of a knife-edge 
theory 
\citep{st2003generation}. Though, now the barrier's height is calculated relative to the abyssal 
ocean, and in order to obtain total conversion instead of rate per length, the barrier has lateral 
size of 240~km. The forcing barotropic current is taken to be uniform and equal to $0.03~m/s$ 
which is 
an average from the numerical simulations. In any case, the extent and the current are linear 
scale factors. The knife-edge generation is compared with the ROMS experiments on  
\fignmlp[C3.fig:ener_var]{C}. Contrary to the expectation of larger conversion by taller 
barrier, the dependence was reverse, i.e. the numerical simulations with smaller WKB-height were 
conversing more barotropic energy. However, such result aligns with previous calculation of 
transmission since one expects smaller barrier to transmit more energy from the trough. 
\fignmlp[C3.fig:ener_var]{B} shows 
relation between the westward wave magnitude scaled by the previously found transmission 
coefficients (i.e. from \fignml[C3.fig:ener_var]{A} black dots are scaled by empty diamonds). 
Here, the dependence is positive, and as more energy reached the western side, amplitude of the 
remote waves was higher, and their effect was stronger and more energy was transferred from the 
barotropic tide into the internal tidal beam.\\

\subsection{Magnitude of Standing wave}
\label{C3.sec:disc_sw}
Additional effect of variable transmission is to change energy balance of the standing wave. To 
investigate this analogy of Solander trough to Fabry-Perot interferometer can be 
invoked\footnote{see another application of such approach to internal wave problem by 
	\cite{mathur2010internal}} as follows. Let conversion rates on the slopes be 
$C_M$ and $C_C$ and reflection coefficients - $r_M,~r_C$ with indexes denoting respectively the 
leeward 
side of the Macquarie Ridge and the Campbell Plateau. Strength of the west component initially is 
just $C_C$, after the first bounce from the ridge, then from the plateau and adding a portion of 
energy that is emitted from the ridge and reflected by the plateau, the flux becomes $r_C r_M C_C 
+ r_C C_M$, the second crossing brings $r_C r_M (r_C r_M) C_C + r_C r_M (r_C) C_M$, the $n$-th 
- $(r_C r_M)^n C_C + (r_C)^n (r_M)^{n-1} C_M$. At some moment, the total flux is $F_W = 
\sum_{i = 1}^N (r_C r_M)^i C_C + (r_C)^i (r_M)^{i-1} C_M$. Now considering equilibrium state, $N 
\rightarrow \infty$, so transition to geometrical series is made, one arrives to
\begin{equation}
\label{C3.eq:fl_fabry}
F_W = \frac{1}{1 - r_C r_M} (C_C + r_C C_M)
\end{equation}
The equation can be further solved for the reflection coefficient. Consider averaged result 
from the numerical experiments \fignmlp[C3.fig:stand_wave]{D} with $C_M \simeq C_C = 0.45~GW$ and 
$F_W = 1.2~GW$ and assuming $r_C = r_M$, it is found that the reflection is at $63\%$ which in 
close agreement with the transmission estimates derived previously. In reality energy losses are 
present during conversion, so letting the wave field to acquire $2/3 \cdot 0.45$ 
from the barotropic tide, the coefficient becomes $75\%$. Regardless, the point is 
clear that such parametrization of the standing wave is appropriate.\\

The Fabry-Perot description stresses amplification of the wave field by a factor in 
\eqref{C3.eq:fl_fabry}. If the multiple reflection were absent, strength of the westward field 
would be    
close to conversion at Auckland Escarpment and consequently, magnitude of the beam would be 
smaller. In fact, 
the test experiment of resolution $1/8^{\circ}$ the Macquarie Ridge was heavily unresolved and 
smoothed having very weak reflectance. As a result, the standing wave was absent and the simulated 
beam was weak and narrow. The amplification factor as well reveals coupling between the opposite 
slopes. As their respective reflectance changes, the consequent effect is multiplicative and 
nonlinear.\\

The description by \eqref{C3.eq:fl_fabry} also augments asymmetrical response in the 
East-West fluxes to variations in the emitting's slope reflectivity. The results on 
\fignml[C3.fig:stand_wave]{D} indicated more 
consistency of the eastward component in the TTIDE-simulation. This implies less variation of the 
ridge reflection than at the plateau that is apparent from \fignm{C3.fig:wv_fld_dist}. Worth noting 
is equality of the averaged E-W components that raises question about its physical nature or 
being an artifact of small number of experiments and/or of the chosen ocean conditions.\\

\subsection{Summary}

\newpage
\section{Discussion}
\label{C3.sec:disc}


%The obtained internal tide description is similar to Luzon strait where near-resonance conditions 
%exist 
%between two almost parallel ridges \citep{buijsman2012double, buijsman2014three} separated by a 
%distance of 0.6 mode-1 wavelength. In the case of the Macquarie Ridge and the Campbell Plateau the 
%separation distance is about the same. But resonance should be weaker since the former has an 
%orientation of $15^{\circ}$ relative to the 
%latter.\\
%
%The geometrical characteristics suggest relevance of wave's travel-time to the observed 
%variability in baroclinic tide 
%production levels and its spatial pattern. To examine this the internal tide dynamics is further 
%studied along a two-dimensional transect crossing the gap (horizontal line on 
%\fignml[C3.fig:gen]{B}) in simulations with diametrically different generation regimes (\sqm{2014} 
%and \sqm{d10-15, 2015}, \fignml[C3.fig:gen]{C}, \fignmlp[C3.fig:stand_wave]{D}). Consequent 
%results are similar to findings of \cite{echeverri2010internal, buijsman2012double} with 
%exception that here the decomposition method augments variations in the mode-1 wave field.\\

%Variation in the coupling process was responsible for the reported changes in the conversion. 

\section{Comparison with Luzon Strait}
\label{C3.sec:disc_luzon}
The same arguments were previously identified by \cite{buijsman2012double} and 
\cite{klymak2013parameterizing} in work related to Luzon strait. These workers (authors?) either numerically integrated or solved mode-matching equations for a problem of two-dimensional internal wave enclosed by ridges. In the later  realistic, three-dimensional simulation \citep{buijsman2014three} reported the amplification factor of about 
3.5\footnote{\citep{buijsman2014three} presented in how many times increase was larger compare to 
when interference is absent (non-resonant), i.e. their definition is 
$\Psi_C = (C_{res} - C_{non-res})/C_{non-res}$.}. The expression 
\eqref{C3.eq:fl_fabry} rather states one-dimensional description of the multiple reflection 
with all phenomenology hidden in separately diagnosed energy terms. Nevertheless, the lower bound can be obtained as ratio of the flux to the conversion, $F/C = 2.6$. This estimate does not account for increase in conversion in comparison to non-resonant condition. However, larger amplification at Luzon Strait also arises as the ridges are near-parallel which promotes more wide-spread amplification. In Solander Trough slanting incidence of the waves \fignmp{C3.fig:wv_fld_dist} lead to spatial variability of the enhancement.\\

It is also worth comparing the documented here variability with results of \cite{kerry2014impact} 
who reported $10~\%$ change in the conversion rates for Luzon strait. This is the same as at the 
Macquarie Ridge while one 
expects, as a first order guess, linear scaling of variability with the amplification factor. 
Apparently, the similar levels are because of different mechanisms. The study of 
\cite{kerry2014impact} 
emphasized role of far-field remote waves radiated by the Mariana arc as primary reason for the 
changes. In this work driving mechanism of the variability was found to be in 
adjustment of the standing wave via the slopes' reflection and stratification. Question arises as 
why Luzon Strait 
does not host similar process and exhibit large deviations being located near vigorous Kuroshio? 
Reason can be 
found in large 
disparity 
between the ridges' height as \cite{klymak2013parameterizing} concludes that the eastern ridge ``casts 
a shadow" over the western. Their respective WKB-heights are 0.2 and 0.6. Following the previous 
discussion on the asymmetry any changes in the dynamical properties of the higher eastern ridge 
influence contribution of the western ridge which is smaller. Its depth also 
inhibits strong effect of the upper ocean conditions. Hence, the eastern 
ridge energy input should be steady if direct influence of stratification on the generation is 
neglected. Though such inequality can produce noticeable shifts in the standing wave, i.e. in the phase of baroclinic pressure and the node's position that can provide explanation of the field observations of \cite{buijsman2014three}.

\section{Summary and Conclusions}
The numerical experiments were conducted to investigate dynamics of the Tasman Sea internal tidal 
beam in realistic and variable oceanographic conditions. This chapter was concerned with origin of 
the beam. The generation takes place along the Macquarie Ridge as the barotropic tide sloshes across 
the steep relief. But the process was enhanced as the strong remote signal constructively interfered with the local production of the baroclinic tide. The largest amplification was localized at the topographic gap separating two highly supercritical 
seamounts. The resulting spatial pattern exemplified role of topographic inhomogeneity in shaping 
conversion ``hotspots".\\

Such dynamical regime of the Macquarie Ridge is analogous to Luzon strait. Both represent case of 
the coupling between lineal internal-tide producing topographies. In the considered 
case the 
remote wave had origin on the slopes of the Campbell Plateau. These waves superposed with the 
ridge-emitted one to form the standing wave that masked magnitude of the elemental, east-west 
oriented components and hindered energy budget analysis. But with the directional decomposition 
technique it was possible to quantify reflection/transmission and compare it with conversion of 
the barotropic tide. These estimates augmented importance of the multiple reflection from the 
opposing slopes. This observation led to application of the Fabry-Perot theory. The obtained simple 
relation was able to describe asymmetries in the east-west signals. As well, the system exhibited 
nonlinear amplification factor that depended on reflection/transmission properties of the involved 
topographies.\\

Degree of the amplification varied with changing hydrographic conditions. And 
since the region is located where two distinct water masses converge into the frontal zone, 
it was presented strong evidence that redistribution of the water types triggers swings in the 
conversion 
rates. Such process was explained by employing two mechanisms. In terms of kinematics the upper column 
stratification directly altered internal tide phase speed and consequently, phase lags with the 
barotropic forcing. While dynamical effect involved variation of the reflection/transmission 
coefficients. It is worth emphasizing that both processes were not fully separated, since the 
estimated coefficients were themselves dependent on the phase of the incident waves. At the same 
time, this suggests existence of a feedback mechanism that forces system of the two coupled 
generators to achieve equilibrium it negative. Such feedback loop could potentially explain the 
symmetry in the ensemble-averaged properties even though reflection at the Campbell Plateau was 
highly 
variable.\\

The variability in energy levels of the remote waves were translated into the tidal beam magnitude. 
However, some disparity between the beam's strength and conversion by the Macquarie Ridge were 
observed. Its nature was not investigated, but likely due to three-dimensionality of the problem 
and dissipative processes. Nevertheless, on average, the beam acquired $87 \pm 7\%$ of the 
converted 
energy. 
Such efficiency is higher than $74\%$ found in studies concerning generation of the beam radiated 
from the Hawaiian islands \citep{carter2008energetics}, since unstable higher modes were not 
accounted for in the reported here budgets. The modeled here losses are hypothesized to be because 
of numerical dissipation \citep{di2006numerical}. Discussion of the dissipation was not considered 
in any depth since the coarse resolution did not 
allow direct simulation of wave breaking and no subgrid parametrization was utilized. Additionally, 
the analysis was not intended to provide robust estimates and accounting of energy losses 
was left out. Though the intriguing dynamics of the generation invites investigation on the 
dissipative processes and nonlinear interactions.\\

The presented dynamical picture of generation at the Macquarie Ridge only further emphasized role 
of remote waves in producing time-variable records through nonlinear coupling. The numerical 
experiments 
exposed role of 
variable ocean environment in shaping those variations. And by virtue of the detailed mechanisms 
response cascaded into the variable strength of the tidal beam. It is unclear over 
what distances away from the generating ridge signature of such processes could be still discerned 
from interactions with mesoscale field of the open ocean. And then what level of 
intermittency should be expected at a distant observational point due to the generation alone.

\subsection{Derivation of conversion from the first principles}
\label{C3.app:conv}
While \eqref{C3.eq:conv} provides a convenient way to quantify energy transformations, it does 
not have much room for physical interpretation. Such as in complicated situation when along with 
local baroclinic tide production a remote signal is present. The resultant perturbation of bottom 
pressure might lead to rather ambiguous result of internal tide destruction. It is said that such 
regime is to occur when a phase difference between $w_{bt}$ and $p_{1}$ is in range of 
$(\pi/2,~3\pi/2)$. This is understood as an internal tide performing work against barotropic 
forcing. Unfortunately, this statement does not directly follow from \eqref{C3.eq:conv}. Hence, to 
provide cleaner physical picture, let derive the expression for conversion rate from the first 
principles. Body force of \citep{baines1982internal}, $F_B$ is performing work by displacing 
isopycnal 
surfaces throughout a water column,
\begin{equation}
\label{C3:eq.convd1}
C(z) = \frac{dW(z)}{dt} = F_{B} w_{bc} = \frac{N^2 (-\vec{u} \cdot \nabla h) z}{i \omega h} 
\frac{d 
	\xi}{dt} = \frac{w_{bt}}{i \omega h} \frac{z d(-b)}{dt} = -\frac{1}{h} w_{bt} zb
\end{equation}
where isopycnal displacements $\xi$ were changed to buoyancy, $b = -N^2 \xi$ and temporal 
variation 
was assumed to be harmonic, $\sim e^{i \omega t}$. At the final step, integration by parts can be 
employed as,
\begin{equation}
\label{C3:eq.convd2}
\int_{-h}^{0} z b dz = \int_{-h}^{0} z d \big( \int^0_{z} b dz \big) = \big( z \int^0_{z} b dz 
\big)\big|_{-h}^0 - \int_{-h}^{0} dz \int_{z}^{0} b dz^{\prime} = h (\int_{-h}^{0}b dz - 
\frac{1}{h} \int_{-h}^{0} dz \int_{z}^{0} b dz^{\prime})
\end{equation}
The last expression is a bottom pressure perturbation. Noteworthy, the baroclinicity condition was 
not employed. Combining \eqref{C3:eq.convd1} and \eqref{C3:eq.convd2}, familiar result 
for conversion rate is obtained. Note that similar approach to \eqref{C3:eq.convd1} was used 
by \citep{nash2006structure} to estimate an upper limit on emitted energy.\\

\subsection{Application of directional spectra to internal tidal fields}
\label{C3.app:ddec}
Similar approaches were used previously in internal tide field programs by 
\cite{hendry1977observations, lozovatsky2003spatial}\footnote{They were based on array 
beamforming method and stationarity of the field} or satellite altimetry by \cite{dushaw2002mapping}, 
or in surface wave studies \citep{longuet1961observations, munk1963directional, long1986inverse}. 
Let pressure of complicated wave field to be described by an angular spectrum
\begin{equation}
\label{C1:eq.spectrum}
p(\vec{r}, t) = \int_0^{2\pi}  d\theta_k S(\theta_k) e^{i \vec{k}(\theta_k) \cdot \vec{r} + 
	\phi(\theta_k) - i \omega t}
\end{equation}
Here each monochromatic wave of wavenumber $k$ travels in direction $\theta$ with 
energy $S(\theta)^2 d\theta$ and phase $\phi(\theta)$. Now time dependence is dropped and all 
physical quantities are given by corresponding complex amplitudes. The statement can be 
reformulated in terms of Fourier transform \citep{munk1963directional}. Recall Jacobi-Anger 
expansion,
\begin{equation}
p(r, \theta) = e^{i \vec{k}(\theta) \cdot \vec{r}} = \sum_{m = -\infty}^{m = \infty} i^{m} J_{m}(k 
r) e^{im(\theta - \theta_k)}
\end{equation}
that shows a field at point $(r, \theta)$ produced by plane wave can be expanded in series of 
Bessel functions and circular functions. Then substitution produces
\begin{equation}
\label{C1:p.eq}
p(r, \theta) = \sum_{m=-\infty}^{m=\infty} J_m(kr) e^{im(\theta + \pi/2)} \Big\{ \int_0^{2\pi}

\end{equation}
Term in brackets represent convolution integrals defining circular Fourier coefficients of 
order $m,~A_m - i B_m$. Series \eqref{C1:p.eq} state an inverse problem that seeks the 
unknown coefficients from the known, measured pressure field that is sampled at a set of points 
$(r_i, \theta_i)$ and if infinite series is truncated at some order $N$. Real and imaginary parts 
constitute two separate problems.\\
The same steps are undertaken for velocities as plane wave polarization relations 
\citep[e.g.,][]{muller2000scattering} are utilized. The following is found
\begin{align}
\label{C1:uv.eq}
\begin{Bmatrix}
u \\ v
\end{Bmatrix}
= \frac{1}{2} \sum_{m = -N}^{m = N} J_{m} (kr) e^{im(\theta + \pi/2)}
\begin{Bmatrix}
(\omega - f) A_{m + 1} + (\omega + f) A_{m - 1} - i [(\omega - f) B_{m + 1} + (\omega + f) B_{m - 
	1}] \\ 
(\omega - f) B_{m + 1} - (\omega + f) B_{m - 1} + i [ (\omega - f) A_{m + 1} - (\omega + f) A_{m - 
	1}]
\end{Bmatrix}
\end{align}
The dependence of currents on wave bearing causes splitting of Fourier coefficients. To describe 
velocity field higher circular harmonics have to be used. Or physically, currents have higher 
spatial wavenumber. As well \eqref{C1:uv.eq} emphasizes an asymmetry between clockwise 
and counterclockwise motions due to the Coriolis effect. Now formally the inverse problem can be stated 
\begin{equation}
y = K x
\end{equation}
where $y$ is comprised of measured dynamical variables, $K$ combines bracketed terms in 
\eqref{C1:p.eq} and \eqref{C1:uv.eq} and $x$ are the unknown Fourier coefficients. Generally, the 
problem is over-determined (i.e., number of unknowns is smaller than number of 
measurements) and unstable to small errors in data, so the model yields physically inconsistent 
results. This is circumvented by seeking a damped least square solution \citep{munk2009ocean} where 
a minimization function is 
\begin{equation}
\label{C1:Tikh_prob}
J = ||K x - y||^2_2 + \alpha ||x||^2_2
\end{equation}
The unknown regularization parameter $\alpha$ acts as a high-pass filter in a singular value 
decomposition of $K$ \citep{bennett1992inverse}. In field studies this is usually set by a 
signal-to-noise ratio \citep{munk2009ocean}, since the parameter scales noise variance (residue) 
to actual signal's strength. To obtain $\alpha$ in data-driven way a straightforward approach is 
adapted that based on 
trade-off curve method \citep{hansen1993use}. In \eqref{C1:Tikh_prob} amount of allowed error 
competes with solution's variance. An optimal parameter is said to balance these factors. This is 
seen as a rapid change in behavior of a curve that relate residue with model's norm as amount of regularization varies. In most cases the curve has a sharp corner connecting aforementioned limits, hence, the 
method's name is a L-curve \citep{hansen1999curve}. And the corner is thought to occur for an 
optimal regularization parameter.\\
In the presented here analysis the equations \eqref{C1:p.eq} and \eqref{C1:uv.eq} are sampled at locations along concentric 
arrays placed at $\lambda,~0.5\lambda,~0.25\lambda$ where $\lambda$ is mode-1 wavelength found in 
the central point. This clearly assumes uniformity of the wave field over sampling window. The 
footprint could be changed to accommodate some spatial variability, but only in expanse of 
resolving power. Further, at each location $u,~v,~p$ from the numerical simulations are used as 
input data and for the central point of the array Fourier coefficients are found. The results are 
then used in reconstructions over an angular sector to obtain elemental components in the 
respective grid point.
