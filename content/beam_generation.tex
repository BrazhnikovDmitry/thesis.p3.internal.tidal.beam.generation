\section*{Abstract}
\textbf{NEW VERSION:}\\
Variability in conversion of barotropic tidal energy into internal tidal waves at the Macquarie 
Ridge is addressed by carrying out numerical experiments with variable hydrographic conditions. The 
main goal of the simulations is to compliment a field program, the Tasman TIdal Dissipation 
Experiment (TTIDE), which was designed to study the fate of the radiated internal tides. The ridge 
and the nearby Campbell Plateau form a double-ridge system known to be conducive to strong 
interference and complicated wave mechanics. Primary dynamical feature is coupling of waves, 
emitted 
from one ridge, with local wave generation, occurring at the another, to amplify or reduce the 
conversion. So that at the Macquarie Ridge found change in the energy transfers to mode-1 by $\pm 
10\%$ and in the 
spatial 
distribution is 
strongly associated with characteristic of the remote, plateau-emitted waves. A novel technique for 
directional decomposition of the interference is utilized to examine the wave-field 
variability. 
The 
result emphasizes 
three-dimensionality of the plateau-emitted waves and the importance of multiple reflections on the 
wave amplitudes. It is shown that time variability results from water mass movement or  
position of the local front by controlling wave speed. Additionally, 
local stratification modulates the reflectivity/transmission and hence, the magnitude of 
the amplification. Variable strength of the conversion implies basin-scale changes to the wave 
field 
that can produce irregular signal in far-field observations such as TTIDE. The results also suggest 
an 
important role of the tidal energy 
loss on the dynamics of the frontal zone.\\



\textbf{OLD VERSION:}\\
The Macquarie Ridge south of New Zealand is a strong generator of semidiurnal internal tidal waves 
forming a 
baroclinic tidal beam. The beam generation takes place in a complex bathymetric region that is 
compared to resonant generation that occurs in Luzon Strait. Local oceanographic conditions are 
highly variable due to presence of the southern subtropical front. These factors produce 
variability in the generation that was studied by numerical simulations initialized with realistic 
hydrographic conditions. The investigation's main goal was to compliment a field program, Tasman 
TIdal Dissipation Experiment (TTIDE), addressed to study fate of the tidal beam. The 
numerical 
simulations yielded a mean value of $1.7~GW$ of barotropic $M_2$ energy was converted into a 
largely mode-1 baroclinic field, with variability of $\pm 10\%$(range - 1.4 and 1.9 GW). The 
changes were correlated with processes in a topographic gap in the ridge and resulted from passage 
of remote baroclinic waves emitted by the Campbell Plateau. Direct analysis of the wave field was 
complicated by interference from multiple wave sources. The complexity was eliminated by a novel 
decomposition technique. The wave field is resolved into directional spectra found as solution to 
an inverse problem. The spectral representation allowed for the quantification of the magnitude and 
arrival time of the remote waves, emphasizing their in-phase relation with the barotropic forcing 
and thus, amplified generation. Alongside this, multiple reflection constituted large portion of 
the 
obtained energy budget. To balance the components this study successfully resorted to 
Fabry-Perot interference in a cavity.\\

The generation enhancement was strongly depended on the three-dimensional structure of the remote 
waves 
rather than along two-dimensional transect arrival time usually associated with the resonant 
condition and previously used for Luzon strait. Hence, complexity of the problem increases as 
there 
is a feedback and coupling in dynamics of 
generation at the straight ridge and complicated topography of the Campbell 
Plateau. In the numerical 
experiments 
alteration of these processes and the remote wave was induced by phase speed anomalies following 
changes in 
stratification, i.e. position of the front. The water mass distribution as well governed 
transmission of the remote wave energy across the ridge.  Consequently, the ocean state served to 
trigger adjustments in the coupled system. The described processes bring about variability in the 
generation and the tidal beam intensity that can cause 
intermittency in far field, many mode-1 wavelengths away and can affect field observations such as 
TTIDE.

\section{Introduction}
Baroclinic semidiurnal tides originate from heaving of isopycnal surfaces driven by a strong 
barotropic flow across topographic relief. This process scatters barotropic tidal 
energy into baroclinic motions \citep{hendershott1981long}, constitutes a 
third of global budget for lunar semidiurnal constituent \citep{egbert2000significant, 
munk1997once} and contributes significantly to internal wave climate \citep{wunsch1975deep} and 
interior ocean mixing \citep{wunsch2004vertical}. At most conversion sites because of highly 
inclined slopes, the radiated 
internal waves of tidal period (internal tides) have vertical wavenumber spectrum dominated by 
highly stable low mode \citep{st2002role} able to transmit tidal energy over ocean basin-scale 
distances \citep{zhao2016global} with yet unknown fate. While generation sites have been identified 
\citep{morozov1995semidiurnal, simmons2004internal, arbic2010concurrent} and some have been 
studied in detail, e.g. Hawaii Islands \citep{rudnick2003tides}, Luzon Strait 
\citep{alford2015formation}, Mendocino Escarpment \citep{althaus2003internal}, 
the Bay of Biscal 
\citep{gerkema2004internal}, and analytical models have been developed \citep{garrett2007internal}, 
there is still large uncertainty about variability in the conversion and its dynamical reasons.\\

The variability can simply arise as ocean state changes. Water column stratification directly 
impacts internal wave dispersion and generation. In fact, the analytical models of generation 
emphasize a ratio between angle of internal wave characteristics to bathymetric slope (referred to 
as slope's criticality \citep{sutherland2010internal, garrett2007internal}) along with a height of 
topography as primary 
quantities in setting conversion levels \citep{llewellyn2003tidal, petrelis2006tidal}. For tall, 
steeply inclined submarine ridges the energy transfer approaches an upper theoretical limit 
\citep{petrelis2006tidal, st2003generation} making them ``oases" of barotropic tide 
scattering and internal tide production \citep{morozov1995semidiurnal, egbert2000significant}. 
Clearly, the energy rates are modulated by changing buoyancy frequency 
\citep{holloway1999internal}, especially when transformation of water properties happens at same 
depths as the steepest bottom gradients \citep{gerkema2004internal}. Nevertheless, in later field 
studies it was realized that presence of external baroclinic tidal signal leads to even larger 
temporal variability \citep{Kelly2010a, zilberman2011incoherent, pickering2015structure}. This 
might occur as opposite ridge slopes affect each other \citep{nash2004internal, 
zilberman2011incoherent, echeverri2010internal} or due to spatially inhomogeneous distribution of 
production hotspots \citep{osborne2011spatial, ponte2013coastal}, or as separate topographic 
features mediate each others generation energy levels \citep{xing1998three, buijsman2012modeling, 
klymak2013parameterizing, buijsman2014three}. The present investigation addresses 
temporal and spatial variability of internal tide generation happening at the Macquarie Ridge, 
south from 
New Zealand. The Tasman Sea geometry \fignmp{C3:fig:geo.map} suggests that 
location and characteristics of major sea bottom features lead to complex internal tide regime with 
potential similarities to well-studied Kaena Ridge and Luzon Strait.\\

The Macquarie Ridge is scatterer of barotropic energy with the radiated waves forming a baroclinic 
tidal beam \citep{zhao2016global}. Its fate was a subject of a recent field 
program, TTIDE \citep{pinkel2015breaking} and one of the goals of the present investigation 
was to compliment the observations with numerical simulations. The beam generation is complicated 
because of the neighboring Campbell Plateau. It is possible that similarly to Luzon Strait, 
constructive interference of the radiated waves at generation sites can substantially amplify 
energy transfer from barotropic tide \citep{buijsman2012double, echeverri2010internal}. In turn, 
this can affect magnitude of the beam and far-field observations. Oceanographic conditions present 
additional difficulties as the Macquarie Ridge is found in region of convergence between 
subtropical (STW) and 
subpolar (SAW) water masses 
\citep{chiswell2015physical}. 
The zone is bounded by two fronts delimited with surface isohalines of $35.1$ and $34.7$ 
\citep{belkin1996southern, hamilton2006structure} \fignmp{C3:fig:geo.map}. The Southern 
Substropical Front 
(S-STF) defines the poleward extent of STW and has strong signature in the upper 100-200 m. The 
associated geostrophic current is weak because of strong density compensation 
\citep{graham2013dynamical}. But topographic 
steering by the ridge produce meanders of S-STF that can result in eddy shedding 
\citep{smith2013interaction}. Mesoscale variability is also induced by atmospheric cyclones and 
local winds that drive front filamentation \citep{james2002summer}. On synoptic scales there is a 
possible 
migration of up to $1^{\circ}$ meridionally \citep{smith2017variability} in response to a seasonal 
cycle of 
insolation and strength of the westerlies.\\

The primary goal of this study was to describe effect of the complex internal wave field on the 
generation of the tidal beam and how the dynamics evolves in response to the changing oceanographic 
conditions. These problems were investigated by means of numerical simulations that combine  
baroclinic tide dynamics and variable, realistic hydrographic conditions (Section 
\ref{C3.sec:model}). General 
characteristics of the generation were delineated in Section \ref{C3.sec:main_res}. Then primary 
mechanism of 
amplification was identified and its connection to the remote internal waves was firmly established 
(Section \ref{C3.sec:amp_mech}) by application of a novel decomposition technique (Appendix 
\ref{C3.app:A1}). 
This allowed for 
complete description of how generation is governed by three-dimensional wave field, dependent upon 
the ocean state (Section \ref{C3.sec:3d_var}). To conclude, effect of the discussed dynamical 
factors were 
quantitatively related to the conversion levels and intensity of the tidal beam (Section 
\ref{C3.sec:disc}).\\

\section{Numerical experiments and analysis}
\subsection{Numerical experiments}
\label{C3.sec:model}
To study dynamics of internal tide generation around New Zealand, propagation in Tasman Sea and 
reflection by Tasmania  
numerical simulations were performed with Regional Ocean Modeling System 
\citep{shchepetkin2005regional}. 
The numerical domain covered the southern Tasman Sea from subantractic waters of $60^{\circ}$ S 
to subtropics in $35^{\circ}$ S. And the zonal extent stretched from $142^{\circ}$ to $172^{\circ}$ 
E. This ensued correct representation of rich regional oceanographic conditions. The horizontal 
grid spacing was taken to be of $1/32^{\circ}$ on average corresponding to discretization of 3 km 
in zonal direction and 2.5 km in meridional. The nonuniformly separated, vertical 50 $s$-levels 
were placed to smoothly follow subsurface terrain.\\
Such discretization of vertical momentum equation tends to induce artificial, horizontal  
along-slope flows \citep{haidvogel1999numerical} due to errors in reproducing of pressure 
gradient force. Especially severe errors are made by steep terrain. The misbehavior is usually 
resolved by artificial smoothing of topography. This procedure additionally increases numerical 
stability, but has an adverse effect on internal tide generation \citep{di2006numerical} since 
primary production sites are collocated with large topographic gradients. To test the numerical 
setup, a sensitivity study was carried out by performing additional experiments with grid size of   
$1/8^{\circ},~1/16^{\circ},~1/64^{\circ}$. The essential for this study 
internal tide behavior manifested at $1/16^{\circ}$ and converged for $1/32^{\circ}$ and 
$1/64^{\circ}$ cases with no marked differences observed.\\

This work addresses the gravest baroclinic mode dynamics in the deep ocean. Spatial 
extent of 
waves is large compared to associated vertical displacements. This ensures linear regime of 
propagation without dispersive and nonhydrostatic effects taken place such as fission into 
solitons. A hydrostatic solver used in ROMS seems to be a proper choice for the simulations. Such 
simplification in wave dynamics was also assumed in previous studies \citep{carter2008energetics, 
merrifield2001generation,  merrifield2002model, kerry2013effects}. In more dynamically 
accurate   
simulations of \citep{kang2012energetics, zhang2011three} the nonhydrostatic effects were found to 
be important only for internal tide propagation in shallow water, while the gravest mode generation 
mostly followed linear dynamics with vertical accelerations to have negligible contribution.\\

The horizontal boundary conditions were imposed to be open for depth-averaged, barotropic flows 
following recommendations of \cite{marchesiello2001open}. The baroclinic fields were  
nudged to zero by linearly increasing lateral viscosity and diffusivity over sponge layers. Through 
the same outer boundaries numerical simulations were forced with barotropic tide. The tidal 
currents and sea level were derived from TPXO atlas, version 7.2 \citep{egbert2002efficient} and 
prescibed as volume transports linearly interpolated onto the model's grid. It was used only the 
largest semidiurnal 
constituent $M_2$. Amplitude ratio between the principal lunar and solar components is 4-to-1 
suggestive of slight open-ocean spring-neap modulation. The diurnal species are weak in the region 
except shoals east of New Zealand \citep{walters2001ocean}.\\

To investigate variations of baroclinic tide dynamics several ocean states were prescribed and 
analyzed separately. In the simplest setting lateral gradients in water properties were absent, 
while buoyancy frequency was set to be representative of the Tasman Basin. The second set of 
simulations 
was comprised to investigate interannual and interseasonal variability (Table 1). And the third 
calculation was intended to cover period of TTIDE/TBEAM/Tshelf field programs 
\citep{pinkel2015breaking}, a single experiment once initialized was left to proceed for three 
months.

\end{table}
The simulations with variable conditions were at first initialized with HYCOM hindcasts
\footnote{(NAVGEM;	downloaded from hycom.org)} for respective start dates. Then during 
integration, 
along with barotropic tidal flow, time-variable, subtidal fields 
of horizontal currents, temperature and salinity were imposed onto the numerical ocean along the 
boundaries. Air-sea fluxes obtained from MERRA-reanalysis \citep{rienecker2011merra} were as well 
utilized to prescribe realistic insolation, air temperature, E-P rate and wind stress.

\subsection{Internal tide analysis}
\label{C3.sec:anlsys}
As seen in \tblnm{ch2:table_exp} the simulations were carried out for 15 days. In all 
cases the first 10 days were regarded as spin up period. Particularly it accommodated a single 
passage of mode-1 from New Zealand 
to Tasmania that takes roughly 7 days. After the spin-up period three 
dimensional fields of velocity, temperature and salinity were sampled hourly over 5 days. And in 
the TTIDE-experiment the quantities were subsampled with 5 day window, hence, naming convention. 
Then the time series were subject to high pass filtering with Butterworth filter 
of 
order $6$ with cut-off time of $36$ 
hours to remove subtidal motions. The filtered signal was further fit in a least square sense to 
the 
principle semidiurnal harmonic. Then the three dimensional fields 
underwent a separation into barotropic and baroclinic signals \citep{cummins1997simulation, 
kunze2002internal, carter2008energetics}. A depth-averaged current is thought to represent a pure 
barotropic signal and any vertical deviation is attributed to a baroclinic wave,
\begin{equation}
\label{ch2:bt_bc_vel}
\vec{u}_{bt}(x,y) = \frac{1}{H} \int_{-H}^{0} \vec{u}(x,y,z)  dz,~\vec{u}_{bc}(x,y,z) =  
\vec{u}(x,y,z) - \vec{u}_{bt}(x,y)
\end{equation}
To obtain distribution of pressure, at first, the linear equation of state and respective 
\textit{TS}-fields were used to determine density perturbations. At second, via the hydrostatic 
approximation consequent vertical integration led to total pressure field. This 
was then subject to baroclinicity condition \citep{kunze2002internal, kelly2010topo}, stating that 
baroclinic pressure 
anomaly associated 
with internal tides is taken to be a deviation from the depth-averaged,
\begin{equation}
\label{ch2:bt_bc_pres}
p(x,y,z) = \int_{-z}^{0} \rho(x,y,z) dz,~p_{bc}(x,y) = p(x,y,z) - \frac{1}{H} \int_{-H(x,y)}^{0} 
\rho(x,y,z) dz
\end{equation}
In the both expressions rigid-lid approximation is used. This is a valid assumption unless 
vertical accelerations are greater than acceleration due to gravity \citep{kelly2010topo}.\\
Vertical distribution of each dynamical variable was then decomposed into vertical modes. The 
structure functions were 
obtained from local Brunt-Vaisala frequency profiles found from time-averaged density fields. 
They were used in Sturm-Liouville problem under the hydrostatic approximation,
\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dz}\Big( \frac{1}{N^2}  \frac{d \psi(z)}{dz}\Big) + c^{-2}_n \psi(z) 
= 0
\end{equation}
where $c_n$ is the mode phase speed in non-rotating ocean. The first 3 eigenmode structural 
function obtained per each numerical grid point were used to describe respective vertical 
distribution in the dynamical fields. And further presented results focus only on mode-1 energetics 
as of its primary importance.\\
Here the low mode is characterized by period-averaged rates of conversion from barotropic tide to 
baroclinic \citep{simmons2004internal, kurapov2003m}, depth-averaged energy flux, horizontal 
kinetic energy (HKE) and available potential energy (APE) that were found as
\begin{align}
\label{C3.eq:conv}
C_{bt\to 1} = -\frac{1}{2}(\cj{\vec{u}_{bt}} \cdot \nabla H) p_{1}|_{z = -H(x,y)}\\
\vec{F} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{H} \cj{\vec{u}_1} p_1 \int_{-H}^{0} \psi_1(z) \psi_1(z) dz\\
HKE = \frac{1}{4} \rho_0 \cj{\vec{u}_1} \vec{u}_1 \int_{-H}^{0} \psi_1(z) \psi_1(z) dz\\
APE = \frac{1}{4c_1^2} \rho_0 \cj{p_1} {p}_1 \int_{-H}^{0} \psi_1(z) \psi_1(z) dz
\end{align}
The coefficient $\frac{1}{2}$ appears due to time averaging and because signals are given in 
complex number notation.\\

The mode-1 internal tide field was additionally subject to directional analysis in order to 
extract elemental signals usually hindered by interference. The details are presented in appendix 
\ref{C3.app:A1} and summarized as follows. Dynamical fields of pressure and currents sampled over 
finite number of grid points can be described by directional 
spectra. Its circular Fourier 
transform was then obtained as solution by damped least squares of an ill-posed inverse problem. 
The 
spectral, directional analysis is different from the approach of \cite{zhao2010long} for two main 
reasons. The underlying inverse model equations \eqref{C1:p.eq} describe continuous distribution of 
energy over all compass directions, rather than a finite number of plane waves. This makes a 
difference in regions 
where wave diffraction prevails. For instance, wave field near sites of internal tide generation or 
scattering will be comprised by angular distribution of energy confined to diffractive lobes 
\citep[e.g.,][]{munroe2005topographic, johnston2003internal}. On 
the other hand, because of finite-window sampling artificial lobes are introduced as in classical 
Fourier analysis. The analysis artifacts lead to unambiguous interpretation, so judgment should be 
used when wave fields are back-synthesized over sampling angular sectors. Secondary, 
velocity measurements are utilized along with pressure observations \eqref{C1:uv.eq}. The 
formulation provides additional constrain on the inverse model. Indeed, the velocity equations tend 
to 
lessen Gibbs phenomena. More importantly, fitting of directional spectra to current and pressure 
observations can be extended to point-wise measurements such as a stationary mooring.\\

All of the above calculations produced sets of dynamical variables for barotropic, baroclinic 
fields and directional representation of the gravest mode for each experiment. To study 
variability in the generation, mean energy characteristics were defined by simple arithmetic mean 
(ensemble-mean) and variability - by standard deviation. Such definitions have a caveat. 
While ensemble-mean allows a straightforward interpretation of mode-1 dynamics, it 
incorporates  
a portion of variable (non-stationary) signal since any energy characteristic is a nonlinear 
quantity \citep{zaron2014time}. On contrary, energy flux, for instance, found from ensemble-mean 
pressure and currents exclusively provides a stationary part. However, if a mode-decomposed signal 
is considered, finding the means entails averaging of vertical basis functions. As a 
consequence, their orthogonality is not preserved leading to uncertainty in the dynamics. 
Performed comparison (not shown) between an ensemble-mean of flux and a flux of ensemble-means did 
not reveal significant differences in spatial structure, though the latter results were smaller.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Internal tide production}
\label{C3.sec:main_res}
The semidiurnal barotropic tide propagates into the Southern Tasman Sea from the North 
\fignmp{C3.fig:BT}. Its phase increases in counterclockwise manner with maximum amplitude of sea 
level located along New Zealand's coast, the behavior typical of Kelvin wave 
\citep{walters2001ocean}. 
The strong tidal phenomena is also observed in shallow Bass Strait, but relatively weak anywhere 
else in the basin. The simulated sea surface tidal oscillation closely followed TPXO7.2 with gross 
features well captured. But the sea level magnitude and cotidal (phase) lines exhibited wave-like, 
small scale perturbations. This is a manifestation of low-mode baroclinic waves 
\fignmp{C3.fig:beam}. The baroclinic tidal field appeared as a complex pattern produced by 
multiple generation sites determined by steep topographic relief. The primary sites were found just 
south 
of 
New Zealand. Here the barotropic Kelvin wave faced the Macquarie Ridge stretched for 2000 km. As 
the barotropic current decayed away from the coastline baroclinic tide production decreased as 
well. 
But low-mode beams were emitted from many sites. Henceforth, analysis concerns the 
most energetic beam emitted from a site at $49.5^{\circ}$ which hereinafter referred to as the 
Macquarie Ridge.\\

The major beam is produced by conversion of the barotropic tidal currents impinging on 
supercritical bathymetry \fignmp{C3.fig:gen}. The strongest generation should occur between depths 
of 1000-3000 m and be spatially confined to two seamounts that are separated with a gap. This 
valley 
topography is deeper and has more gradual slopes, so it should play a secondary role in production 
of the tidal beam. But from distribution of conversion rates \fignmlp[C3.fig:gen]{B} and its 
spatial averages \fignmlp[C3.fig:gen]{C} a different perspective emerged. Generation at the gap 
made up a significant portion of the converted energy and displayed unusually high variability in 
magnitude. Degree of spatial variation within the averaging regions was much smaller. However,  
the generation pattern was rearranging between the experiments. The production could diminish in 
the gap and peak value could move into the northern or southern part of the ridge.\\

The Macquarie ridge on average converts $1.7 \pm 0.2~GW$ of the surface tide into mode-1 
baroclinic tide. This is a half of production at Kaena Ridge, Hawaii \citep{carter2008energetics} 
and tenfold smaller than Luzon Strait \citep{alford2011energy, kerry2014impact}. But similar to 
Luzon Strait the Macquarie ridge features complex internal tide dynamics that was manifested as 
regions of negative conversion (green shading, \fignml[C3.fig:gen]{B}). It is known 
\citep{Kelly2010a} that such reverse energy transfer and destruction of internal tide is driven by 
coupling with remote baroclinic waves. In fact, oppositely located slopes of the Campbell Plateau 
(Auckland Escarpment) provided a source of such signal. Further interference created a standing 
wave \fignmp{C3.fig:stand_wave}. The wave presence was evident in the 
distribution of 
HKE marked by a 
node in the middle of Solander trough. Additionally, around the node energy flux formed a circular 
pattern \fignmp{C3.fig:stand_wave} with counterclockwise progression since the Coriolis parameter 
is 
negative in the Southern Hemisphere.\\

By the directional method (appendix \ref{C3.app:A1}) the standing wave was separated 
into elemental east-west oriented components \fignmlp[C3.fig:stand_wave]{B, C}. On the leeward side 
of the Macquarie Ridge generation took place at the same seamounts but there was a region of 
destruction that coincided with incidence of waves emitted by the escarpment. On the trough's 
eastern side the generation had richer structure both due to more complicated topography and 
barotropic forcing \fignmlp[C3.fig:BT]{A}, but also due to effect of the Macquarie ridge waves on 
the local generation. Respective energy transfer across the trough was quantified and compared with 
spatially integrated conversion rates \fignmlp[C3.fig:stand_wave]{D}. On average, energy in each 
elemental wave field was almost equally divided amongst waves reflected from the supercritical 
slopes and wave energy derived from the barotropic field. Though the system exhibited large 
departures from the average state due to variable conditions of the coupling on the slopes.\\

The obtained internal tide description is similar to Luzon strait where near-resonance conditions 
exist 
between two almost parallel ridges \citep{buijsman2012double, buijsman2014three} separated by a 
distance of 0.6 mode-1 wavelength. In the case of the Macquarie Ridge and the Campbell Plateau the separation distance is about the same. But resonance should be weaker since the former has an orientation of $15^{\circ}$ relative to the 
latter.\\

The geometrical characteristics suggest relevance of wave's travel-time to the observed variability in baroclinic tide 
production levels and its spatial pattern. To examine this the internal tide dynamics is further 
studied along a two-dimensional transect crossing the gap (horizontal line on 
\fignml[C3.fig:gen]{B}) in simulations with diametrically different generation regimes (\sqm{2014} 
and \sqm{d10-15, 2015}, \fignml[C3.fig:gen]{C}, \fignmlp[C3.fig:stand_wave]{D}). Consequent 
results are similar to findings of \cite{echeverri2010internal, buijsman2012double} with 
exception that here the decomposition method augments variations in the mode-1 wave field.\\

%Variation in the coupling process was responsible for the reported changes in the conversion. 

\subsection{Coupling of local generation with remote waves}
\label{C3.sec:amp_mech}
\textbf{NEW:}
\newpage
Conversion rates represent work done by barotropic tidal current in displacing isopycnal 
interfaces. Equation \ref{C3.eq:conv} quantifies the process as correlation 
between the 
resultant 
baroclinic bottom pressure and the vertical component of the current. Phase lag between the two  
determines sign of the energy transfer. Thus, the conversion can be negative 
if the downward current, for example, coincides with heaving of isopycnals. Such situation 
might arise when non-locally generated internal tidal waves are present. When 
the remote waves are in-phase, an amplified energy transfer from the surface tide takes place. Note 
the 
interaction 
is non-linear, i.e. the total energy transfer is not explained by a superposition of the two 
processes, 
since it involves coupling through non-linear bottom boundary condition on the inclined slope.\\

The distinct pathways in energy transfer were highlighted in two experiments, \sqm{2014} and 
\sqm{d10-d15}. \fignm{C3.fig:gen_2d} provides respective wave field development. At ebb on the 
ridge's west side \fignmlp[C3.fig:gen_2d]{A, C} the downward barotropic current forced isopycnals 
to 
dip near bottom. 
At that moment the conversion was found to be positive in both experiments as shown by respective 
time series 
on \fignml[C3.fig:gen_2d]{E}. However, in \sqm{2014} about hour 7 the transfer became negative as, 
contrary to the forcing, isopycnals began to rise. Later at slack \fignmlp[C3.fig:gen_2d]{B} the 
barotropic current reversed direction and with it the conversion changed sign again. Obviously, 
the process of energy transfer was distorted and resulted in weak internal tide generation 
\fignmlp[C3.fig:gen_2d]{F}. 
The example of \sqm{d10-15} revealed other regime. Throughout the ebb flow the isopycnals 
were permanently depressed signifying larger transfer of the barotropic energy.\\

The striking difference originated from dynamics of the remote internal waves. At the 
same time with the ebb flow in \sqm{d10-15} a mode-1 wave crossed the ridge, evident in the 
baroclinic pressure by characteristic vertical dipole pattern. The wave travel was accompanied by 
downward isopycnal motion along the slopes of the ridge. On the west side the in-phase coupling 
was driving the excessive energy transfer, while the east side having the oppositely directed 
forcing manifested the baroclinic energy loss \fignmlp[C3.fig:gen_2d]{F}. Contrary, the mode-1 wave 
was not observed on the ridge slopes in \sqm{2014}. And the east side exhibited generation of an 
internal wave seen as 
a ray emitted from the ridge crest on \fignmlp[C3.fig:gen_2d]{A}. It appears that later on the ray 
destructively interfered with the west-side generation producing the prolonged periods of the 
negative conversion.\\
It should be noted that the remote mode-1 wave was present in the Solanders trough 
($162.25^{\circ}$) in both examples, but the wave travel 
paths were distinct. This conclusion was augmented by the directional decomposition and respective 
wave phase distribution (Fig.). The trough was occupied 
by the standing wave seen as almost constant phase and hence, no propagation of the total signal. 
Near the Campbell plateau ($162.25^{\circ}$) the decomposition revealed almost equal contribution 
of the east and west-traveling waves. However, by the ridge in \sqm{d10-15} the total signal was 
seen to propagate across the ridge with the westward component to be dominant. In \sqm{2014} 
the eastward wave was stronger and the phase tended to $-180^{\circ}$ (relative to the west side's 
surface tide) emphasizing local origin. The arrival to the ridge of the westward wave was similar 
in the given examples and the phase lag with the forcing was the same, thus, the different wave 
dynamics resulted from difference in the westward wave incidence on the ridge which is explored in 
detail further.\\

\textbf{OLD:}
Vertically integrated conversion rate (\ref{C3.eq:conv}) quantifies how much work is done by the 
baroptropic tide in displacing isopycnal interfaces against buoyant forces throughout a water 
column\footnote{Following this concept a derivation from the first principles is provided in 
appendix \ref{C3.app:B} \citep[see also][]{kurapov2003m, kelly2010topo}.}. It should be recognized 
that the barotropic forcing might be oppositely directed to vertical motions if somewhere in the 
water column other processes take place. Such as in case of \sqm{2014}-simulation 
\fignmlp[C3.fig:gen_2d]{A, B} during ebb stage on the tideward side (solid black line, 
$164.2^{\circ}$) throughout the column energy was transferred into the baroclinic field 
\fignmlp[C3.fig:gen_2d]{E}. But note that along the bottom an internal wave ray was developing as 
isopycnals were lifting following preceding flooding stage. Hence, at this location and depths the 
locally generated internal wave did work against the downward barotropic flow. As the contribution 
was growing, at about hour 7 on \fignml[C3.fig:gen_2d]{E} the net conversion became negative. Then 
it flipped sign as the tidal current reversed its direction \fignmlp[C3.fig:gen_2d]{B}. Averaged 
over the tidal period the transfer was positive, i.e. the surface tide lost energy, but weak 
compare to \sqm{d10-15} simulation \fignmlp[C3.fig:gen_2d]{C-D}. This experiment demonstrated  
amplification of production on the gap's slope because of strong presence of the remotely generated 
internal tide. Its propagation from Solander Trough ($165^{\circ}$) and across the gap was the 
major 
difference between the two situations. In \sqm{d10-15} along slope formation of an internal wave 
was still found, but due to the shoaling mode-1, conversion was positive throughout the full tidal 
cycle. In summary, the remote signal supported positive energy transfer during periods of tidal 
current reversals, so that excess of energy was drawn from the surface tide into the baroclinic 
field \fignmlp[C3.fig:gen_2d]{E}.\\

Phase lag between localized barotropic forcing and remote, incident signal is a 
crucial parameter in describing the system dynamics which is illustrated by the leeward side (black 
dashed line, $164.5^{\circ}E$). Here the vertical barotropic flow was opposite to the previous 
location. For \sqm{d10-15} the traveling mode-1 internal tide was losing energy as it was 
displacing 
isopycnals oppositely to the forcing. In actuality, reflection took place as an internal 
wave ray was emitted towards the trough. The associated baroclinic currents were easterly downward, 
same direction as group speed \fignmlp[C3.fig:gen_2d]{C-D}. In \sqm{2014} the along slope current 
was opposite, coinciding with the isopycnal displacements and the flow of the surface tide. 
Thus, in both cases the energy propagated downward and away from the slope, but the corresponding 
phases were $180^{\circ}$-shifted denoting either reflection of the internal tide or unobstructed 
generation respectively \fignml[C3.fig:gen_2d]{E}. The period-averaged conversion rates highlighted 
the differences \fignmlp[C3.fig:gen_2d]{F}. Overall, the simulations demonstrated three distinct 
cases of energy transfer between barotropic and baroclinic modes on sloping bottom and pathway 
taken was driven by the remote wave. Its influence was further elucidated by exploring phase 
distribution along the section \fignmlp[C3.fig:gen_2d]{G} in the mode-1 pressure field.\\

Phase of the superposed, total wave showed a stagnant region eastward from of $165^{\circ}E$ that 
corresponded to the node in HKE \fignmlp[C3.fig:stand_wave]{A}. As before the decomposition 
revealed it as a sum of the ridge-generated waves (eastward) and the escarpment-originated waves 
(westward). In \sqm{d10-15} west of $165^{\circ}E$ there was almost a free propagation of the 
``escarpment" waves since the total signal was similar and the eastward component was weak. At the 
previously considered locations the mode-1 phase wave was above $-90^{\circ}$ which 
resulted respectively in enhancement or destruction on the opposite gap's slopes. Note that the 
phases were referenced relative to the barotropic flow on the tideward side. In \sqm{2014} on the 
leeward side the total signal was mostly described by the eastward waves and the phase tended to 
$-180^{\circ}$, hence, the wave was mainly related to the local generation. On the tideward side 
waves in both experiments were in the same quadrature with the local barotropic flow, but 
\sqm{d10-15} showed twenty-fold stronger conversion resulted not only from higher bottom 
pressure, but also because of smaller phase lag with the barotropic forcing.

\subsection{Three dimensional structure of the wave fields}
\label{C3.sec:3d_var}
Conversion rate in the gap strongly depended on magnitude and phase of the incident, westward wave 
and 
hence, was related to three dimensional structure of the wave field. The decomposition analysis 
further delineated associated variations \fignmp{C3.fig:wv_fld_dist}. The westward wave in 
\sqm{2014} was small as generation at the Campbell Plateau was diminished (see also 
\fignml[C3.fig:gen]{C}). And since lines of constant phase (isochrons) were slanted relative to the 
ridge, such 
largely oblique incidence even more reduced across topography propagation. While in all other 
experiments the cross-ridge component was much stronger as the incidence was more direct. 
Furthermore, the westward wave characteristics were not permanent which is illustrated 
by 
transition happened over 3 weeks in the TTIDE-simulation \fignmlp[C3.fig:wv_fld_dist]{B-C}. The 
overall 
production at the Macquarie Ridge increased from 1.6 to 1.9 GW \fignmlp[C3.fig:gen]{D} as the 
westward 
wave started to arrive later. The resulted smaller phase lag with the local production led to the 
observed growth.\\

The westward wave field was shaped by dynamics occurring on the slopes of the Campbell 
Plateau where similar to the Macquarie Ridge reflection coupled with local generation. In the 
numerical experiments the coupling process exhibited highly variable spatial pattern of 
generation/destruction. For \sqm{2014} there was a strong destruction evident near $(166.5E, 
48.75S)$, \fignmlp[C3.fig:wv_fld_dist]{A} with the other cases showing insignificant energy loss. 
This 
location corresponded to impingement of the eastward-traveling wave produced at the northern 
seamount \fignmlp[C3.fig:wv_fld_dist]{bottom row}. And as before its phase lag to the surface  
tide 
was a primary factor. That is, earlier arrival such as in \sqm{d10-15} and \sqm{d35-40} 
corresponded to weak energy losses and this also explained higher production rates at the 
Campbell 
Plateau in the later period \fignmlp[C3.fig:gen]{C}.\\

It was straightforward to establish a relation between the phase of the eastward waves and mode-1 
eigenspeed under extreme conditions. For example, the generation in \sqm{2014} was   
exacerbated by negative phase speed anomaly of $15\%$, i.e. $\sim 20^{\circ}$ or 
$40$ minute later arrival. Opposite situation was seen for \sqm{uniform}-experiment where higher 
phase speed led to much earlier arrivals and very strong amplification (compare 
\fignml[C3.fig:gen]{B} with \fignml[C3.fig:wv_fld_dist]{A-C}). But in the 
cases of modest departure, such interpretation was complicated with initial phase of the 
eastward waves. The field emitted by the northern seamount was about at $0^{\circ}$ in 
\sqm{d10-15}, while in \sqm{d35-40} - $\sim 50^{\circ}$. In turn, the difference 
arose from incidence and arrival of the westward waves.\\

The westward wave characteristic heavily depends on complicated pattern of multiple site 
generation/reflection at the Campbell Plateau rather than anomalies in the phase speed alone. This 
is contrary to the eastward waves. This field is produced by simpler generation pattern. And 
since the isochrons closely repeated the emitting seamount's topography, the plane wave description 
is fairly appropriate and hence, facilitates linear phase dependence on inverse of the phase 
speed.\\

Accordingly, phase speed and stratification change should be thought as a triggering mechanism for 
adjustments in the generation patterns. To illustrate this, respective hydrographic conditions are 
presented on \fignm{C3.fig:ocean_cond}. For the region sea surface salinity draws distinction 
between warmer 
subtropical waters (STW is seen by brighter colors on the figure) and fresher subantarctic waters 
(SAW - colder color) and is well representative of the upper water column density structure. As 
consequence, there was a strong correspondence with phase speed anomalies 
\fignmlp[C3.fig:wv_fld_dist]{lower panels}. This is exemplified for two locations. In the 
first case it was observed development of a frontal filament following passage of an atmospheric 
cyclone \fignmlp[C3.fig:ocean_cond]{B, C}. The advected STW forced stronger pycnocline in the 
upper 
200 m (\fignm{C3.fig:ocean_cond} lower panels designated by '1', blue and green lines) and the 
positive anomaly. It is notable that in \sqm{2014} (red line) a mixture of SAW and STW led to 
weaker stratification as there was pronounced density compensation. The second position was chosen 
to display a warm-core eddy that created large, localized deviations from the mean 
\fignmlp[C3.fig:wv_fld_dist]{D}. The weak vertical density gradient was present again and 
Brunt-Vaisala frequency was exceptionally small in the upper 100 m. Despite this the eigenspeed was 
high. This was caused by deeper pycnocline ($\sim 1000~m$) that separates fresher Antarctica 
Intermediate Water from the upper ocean \citep{chiswell2015physical}. In this experiment the eddy 
had strong saline signature that reinforced the secondary pycnocline and it exerted higher 
influence on the eigenfunctions. The examples lead to conclusion that presence of STW produce 
positive anomalies, while opposite is true for SAW. And the converging water masses has direct 
effect on the internal tide kinematics.

\section{Discussion}
\label{C3.sec:disc}

\subsection{Conversion}
\label{C3.sec:disc_conv}
The presented evidences state importance of the wave field in Solander trough for the internal 
tidal beam. Dynamics on the trough's slopes is closely linked to the coupling processes and is 
affected by the ocean state. It also seems that stationary regime can be hardly observed. Changes 
in stratification and phase speeds control respective lags in the arrival times to affect energy 
transfers and strength of the westward waves that mediate the beam generation.\\

This conclusion is evaluated by the energy characteristics plotted on 
\fignml[C3.fig:ener_var]{A, B}. It is seen that variability of generation at the gap explains  
$75\%$ of variability in the overall production at the Macquarie ridge. While the generation at the 
gap is mainly related to strength of the incident, westward wave. The amplitude was 
quantified as integral of energy flux across a red line on \fignml[C3.fig:wv_fld_dist]{F} and 
given by black line on \fignml[C3.fig:ener_var]{B}. Correlation coefficient between the 
generation and the flux is $R^2 = 50\%$, but after omitting \sqm{uniform} experiment, $R^2$ rises 
to $80\%$. The \sqm{uniform} experiment is an outlier because the prescribed stratification,  
typical of the deep Tasman basin, led to unrealistically high phase speeds in the 
generation region. The westward wave arrived in-phase with the local barotropic tide on the 
lee side of the ridge and partly out-phase on the western side seen as destruction on 
\fignml[C3.fig:gen]{B} at the northern seamount. This regime 
is clearly opposite to the other experiments \fignmlp[C3.fig:gen]{C}.\\

Direct effect of variable stratification on the generation has also to be investigated because of 
the highly dynamical ocean environment. To account for this, an analytical model of 
\cite{st2003generation} was applied. The ridge was thought to be a two-dimensional knife-edge 
topography whose height was found from the topography's mean depth in WKB-scaled vertical 
coordinate \citep{althaus2003internal} relative to the abyssal depth. The knife-edge barrier was  
transversely stretched for 240 km and was subject to barotropic current of $0.03~m/s$ 
representative of the ROMS simulations. Generally, under conditions of strongly stratified ocean 
the knife-edge ridge is taller and sheds more baroclinic energy. But the calculation resulted in 
converse dependence \fignmlp[C3.fig:ener_var]{C}. The inconsistency was resolved by 
considering effect of stratification on energy transmission across the knife-edge barrier. To 
estimate this the ridge's height ratio was obtained relative to Solander Trough. Than closed-form 
solutions of \citep{larsen1969internal},
\begin{equation}
\label{C3.eq:ke_transm}
R_{knife} = \sin^2 \frac{1}{2} \pi h - \frac{1}{2} P_2( \cos \pi h ) + (\frac{1}{2} - \sin^2 
\frac{1}{2} \pi h) P_1( \cos \pi h ),~
T_{knife} = (1 - R_{knife})^2
\end{equation}
where $P_1,~P_2$ - the Legendre polynomials and $h$ - ratio of depth occupied by the barrier to 
the ocean depth, was used. The values obtained for each simulation are plotted on 
\fignmlp[C3.fig:ener_var]{A, empty diamonds} and then they were used to scale the overall 
incident flux (integrated across blue line on \fignml[C3.fig:stand_wave]{C}). 
\fignml[C3.fig:ener_var]{C} suggests the change in stratification affects ridge's transmission 
and taller ridge allows less across-ridge transport. The result does not exclude the implied role 
of stratification, but rather emphasizes the primary mechanism of amplified generation due to the 
remote wave.\\

It is apparent that the calculation based on the knife-edge theory is an underestimate. For 
instance, using \eqref{C3.eq:ke_transm} transmission across the gap alone is about $15\%$ 
\fignmlp[C3.fig:ener_var]{B}, but this contradicts largely subcritical slope and only small  
change in the crossing mode-1 \fignmlp[C3.fig:gen_2d]{C-D}. Using the decomposition method 
different estimates were obtained by taking ratio between the trough's incident to the westward 
fluxes on the 
ridge \fignmlp[C3.fig:gen_dynamics]{A-B, purple filled dots}. The 
estimates seem to be more plausible as the gap alone transmits $47 \pm 8~\%$ and the Macquarie 
ridge - $35 \pm 4~\%$. Nevertheless, these values should also 
be taken with a grain of salt as the wave field near the ridge's top is not homogeneous breaking the 
underlying assumption of the method. In actuality, if the above estimates were used in the same way 
as the knife-edge calculations, i.e. to produce \fignmlp[C3.fig:ener_var]{D}, no correlation 
would be found. Though pertinent outcome of the analysis is in similar character of variation for 
the differently estimated transmission coefficients. Therefore, dynamical effect of stratification 
is to control across ridge passage of waves.\\

Spatially different transmission or reflection along the Macquarie Ridge also explains spatial 
distribution of conversion and its variation \fignmlp[C3.fig:gen]{C}. This was quantified by 
differentiating \eqref{C3.eq:conv} with respect to involved physical parameters and than replacing the 
differentials with variances \citep{kerry2014impact}. The obtained expressions detail how much of 
change in the conversion is caused by particular parameter \fignmp{C3.fig:var_sp}. It is found that 
total variation amounts to 0.9 GW, while previously it was reported at 0.2 GW (Section 
\ref{C3.sec:main_res}). The disparity arises as the parameters are not statistically independent. 
For example, change in vertical velocity $w_{bt}$ also affects bottom baroclinic pressure producing 
non-zero covariance between the two. Nevertheless, the obtained distribution shows a pattern that 
corroborates previous observations. The variation due to phase lags are the strongest in the gap 
and smaller over the seamounts, while opposite holds for magnitude of the bottom pressure. 
Therefore, in the gap because of the weak local generation and comparable magnitude of the remote 
signal, the westward wave smears both amplitude and phase of the resultant bottom pressure. On the 
steeper flanks of the seamounts the local generation is strong and the superposition mainly  
modulates the amplitude. Such point is easily demonstrated by plotting vector diagrams. The variability analysis demonstrates that on more gradual slopes remote waves perturb conversion stronger than on steep slopes. 
Such as at the Auckland Escarpment, all of variability is dictated by phase of the arriving eastward 
waves supporting discussion in Section \ref{C3.sec:3d_var}.\\
Additionally, there is about $10\%$ variations associated with the barotropic forcing which is mostly found in regions of the highly supercritical seamounts. Variable  steering of the barotropic tide could be named as a reason  \citep{holloway1999internal}. More likely though, distortions were introduced into vertically averaged component by strong shoaling of internal tide.\\

\subsection{Standing wave}
\label{C3.sec:disc_sw}
Additional effect of variable transmission is to change energy balance of the standing wave. To 
investigate this analogy of Solander trough to Fabry-Perot interferometer can be 
invoked\footnote{see another application of such approach to internal wave problem by 
\cite{mathur2010internal}} as follows. Let conversion rates on the slopes be 
$C_M$ and $C_C$ and reflection coefficients - $r_M,~r_C$ with indexes denoting respectively the leeward 
side of the Macquarie Ridge and the Campbell Plateau. Strength of the west component initially is 
just $C_C$, after the first bounce from the ridge, then from the plateau and adding a portion of 
energy that is emitted from the ridge and reflected by the plateau, the flux becomes $r_C r_M C_C 
+ r_C C_M$, the second crossing brings $r_C r_M (r_C r_M) C_C + r_C r_M (r_C) C_M$, the $n$-th 
- $(r_C r_M)^n C_C + (r_C)^n (r_M)^{n-1} C_M$. At some moment, the total flux is $F_W = 
\sum_{i = 1}^N (r_C r_M)^i C_C + (r_C)^i (r_M)^{i-1} C_M$. Now considering equilibrium state, $N 
\rightarrow \infty$, so transition to geometrical series is made, one arrives to
\begin{equation}
\label{C3.eq:fl_fabry}
F_W = \frac{1}{1 - r_C r_M} (C_C + r_C C_M)
\end{equation}
The equation can be further solved for the reflection coefficient. Consider averaged result 
from the numerical experiments \fignmlp[C3.fig:stand_wave]{D} with $C_M \simeq C_C = 0.45~GW$ and 
$F_W = 1.2~GW$ and assuming $r_C = r_M$, it is found that the reflection is at $63\%$ which in 
close agreement with the transmission estimates derived previously. In reality energy losses are 
present during conversion, so letting the wave field to acquire $2/3 \cdot 0.45$ 
from the barotropic tide, the coefficient becomes $75\%$. Regardless, the point is 
clear that such parametrization of the standing wave is appropriate.\\

The Fabry-Perot description stresses amplification of the wave field by a factor in 
\eqref{C3.eq:fl_fabry}. If the multiple reflection were absent, strength of the westward field would be    
close to conversion at Auckland Escarpment and consequently, magnitude of the beam would be smaller. In fact, 
the test experiment of resolution $1/8^{\circ}$ the Macquarie Ridge was heavily unresolved and 
smoothed having very weak reflectance. As a result, the standing wave was absent and the simulated 
beam was weak and narrow. The amplification factor as well reveals coupling between the opposite 
slopes. As their respective reflectance changes, the consequent effect is multiplicative and nonlinear.\\

The description by \eqref{C3.eq:fl_fabry} also augments asymmetrical response in the 
East-West fluxes to variations in the emitting's slope reflectivity. The results on 
\fignml[C3.fig:stand_wave]{D} indicated more 
consistency of the eastward component in the TTIDE-simulation. This implies less variation of the 
ridge reflection than at the plateau that is apparent from \fignm{C3.fig:wv_fld_dist}. Worth noting 
is equality of the averaged E-W components that raises question about its physical nature or 
being an artifact of small number of experiments and/or of the chosen ocean conditions.\\

\subsection{Comparison with Luzon Strait}
\label{C3.sec:disc_luzon}
The same arguments were previously identified by \cite{buijsman2012double} and 
\cite{klymak2013parameterizing} in work related to Luzon strait. These workers (authors?) either numerically integrated or solved mode-matching equations for a problem of two-dimensional internal wave enclosed by ridges. In the later  realistic, three-dimensional simulation \citep{buijsman2014three} reported the amplification factor of about 
3.5\footnote{\citep{buijsman2014three} presented in how many times increase was larger compare to 
when interference is absent (non-resonant), i.e. their definition is 
$\Psi_C = (C_{res} - C_{non-res})/C_{non-res}$.}. The expression 
\eqref{C3.eq:fl_fabry} rather states one-dimensional description of the multiple reflection 
with all phenomenology hidden in separately diagnosed energy terms. Nevertheless, the lower bound can be obtained as ratio of the flux to the conversion, $F/C = 2.6$. This estimate does not account for increase in conversion in comparison to non-resonant condition. However, larger amplification at Luzon Strait also arises as the ridges are near-parallel which promotes more wide-spread amplification. In Solander Trough slanting incidence of the waves \fignmp{C3.fig:wv_fld_dist} lead to spatial variability of the enhancement.\\

It is also worth comparing the documented here variability with results of \cite{kerry2014impact} 
who reported $10~\%$ change in the conversion rates for Luzon strait. This is the same as at the 
Macquarie Ridge while one 
expects, as a first order guess, linear scaling of variability with the amplification factor. 
Apparently, the similar levels are because of different mechanisms. The study of 
\cite{kerry2014impact} 
emphasized role of far-field remote waves radiated by the Mariana arc as primary reason for the 
changes. In this work driving mechanism of the variability was found to be in 
adjustment of the standing wave via the slopes' reflection and stratification. Question arises as 
why Luzon Strait 
does not host similar process and exhibit large deviations being located near vigorous Kuroshio? 
Reason can be 
found in large 
disparity 
between the ridges' height as \cite{klymak2013parameterizing} concludes that the eastern ridge ``casts 
a shadow" over the western. Their respective WKB-heights are 0.2 and 0.6. Following the previous 
discussion on the asymmetry any changes in the dynamical properties of the higher eastern ridge 
influence contribution of the western ridge which is smaller. Its depth also 
inhibits strong effect of the upper ocean conditions. Hence, the eastern 
ridge energy input should be steady if direct influence of stratification on the generation is 
neglected. Though such inequality can produce noticeable shifts in the standing wave, i.e. in the phase of baroclinic pressure and the node's position that can provide explanation of the field observations of \cite{buijsman2014three}.

\section{Summary and Conclusions}
The numerical experiments were conducted to investigate dynamics of the Tasman Sea internal tidal 
beam in realistic and variable oceanographic conditions. This chapter was concerned with origin of 
the beam. The generation takes place along the Macquarie Ridge as the barotropic tide sloshes across 
the steep relief. But the process was enhanced as the strong remote signal constructively interfered with the local production of the baroclinic tide. The largest amplification was localized at the topographic gap separating two highly supercritical 
seamounts. The resulting spatial pattern exemplified role of topographic inhomogeneity in shaping 
conversion ``hotspots".\\

Such dynamical regime of the Macquarie Ridge is analogous to Luzon strait. Both represent case of 
the coupling between lineal internal-tide producing topographies. In the considered 
case the 
remote wave had origin on the slopes of the Campbell Plateau. These waves superposed with the 
ridge-emitted one to form the standing wave that masked magnitude of the elemental, east-west 
oriented components and hindered energy budget analysis. But with the directional decomposition 
technique it was possible to quantify reflection/transmission and compare it with conversion of 
the barotropic tide. These estimates augmented importance of the multiple reflection from the 
opposing slopes. This observation led to application of the Fabry-Perot theory. The obtained simple 
relation was able to describe asymmetries in the east-west signals. As well, the system exhibited 
nonlinear amplification factor that depended on reflection/transmission properties of the involved 
topographies.\\

Degree of the amplification varied with changing hydrographic conditions. And 
since the region is located where two distinct water masses converge into the frontal zone, 
it was presented strong evidence that redistribution of the water types triggers swings in the 
conversion 
rates. Such process was explained by employing two mechanisms. In terms of kinematics the upper column 
stratification directly altered internal tide phase speed and consequently, phase lags with the 
barotropic forcing. While dynamical effect involved variation of the reflection/transmission 
coefficients. It is worth emphasizing that both processes were not fully separated, since the 
estimated coefficients were themselves dependent on the phase of the incident waves. At the same 
time, this suggests existence of a feedback mechanism that forces system of the two coupled 
generators to achieve equilibrium it negative. Such feedback loop could potentially explain the 
symmetry in the ensemble-averaged properties even though reflection at the Campbell Plateau was 
highly 
variable.\\

The variability in energy levels of the remote waves were translated into the tidal beam magnitude. 
However, some disparity between the beam's strength and conversion by the Macquarie Ridge were 
observed. Its nature was not investigated, but likely due to three-dimensionality of the problem 
and dissipative processes. Nevertheless, on average, the beam acquired $87 \pm 7\%$ of the 
converted 
energy. 
Such efficiency is higher than $74\%$ found in studies concerning generation of the beam radiated 
from the Hawaiian islands \citep{carter2008energetics}, since unstable higher modes were not 
accounted for in the reported here budgets. The modeled here losses are hypothesized to be because 
of numerical dissipation \citep{di2006numerical}. Discussion of the dissipation was not considered 
in any depth since the coarse resolution did not 
allow direct simulation of wave breaking and no subgrid parametrization was utilized. Additionally, 
the analysis was not intended to provide robust estimates and accounting of energy losses 
was left out. Though the intriguing dynamics of the generation invites investigation on the 
dissipative processes and nonlinear interactions.\\

The presented dynamical picture of generation at the Macquarie Ridge only further emphasized role 
of remote waves in producing time-variable records through nonlinear coupling. The numerical 
experiments 
exposed role of 
variable ocean environment in shaping those variations. And by virtue of the detailed mechanisms 
response cascaded into the variable strength of the tidal beam. It is unclear over 
what distances away from the generating ridge signature of such processes could be still discerned 
from interactions with mesoscale field of the open ocean. And then what level of 
intermittency should be expected at a distant observational point due to the generation alone.

\subsection{Application of directional spectra to internal tidal fields}
\label{C3.app:A1}
Similar approaches were used previously in internal tide field programs by 
\cite{hendry1977observations, lozovatsky2003spatial}\footnote{They were based on array 
beamforming method and stationarity of the field} or satellite altimetry by \cite{dushaw2002mapping}, 
or in surface wave studies \citep{longuet1961observations, munk1963directional, long1986inverse}. 
Let pressure of complicated wave field to be described by an angular spectrum
\begin{equation}
\label{C1:eq.spectrum}
p(\vec{r}, t) = \int_0^{2\pi}  d\theta_k S(\theta_k) e^{i \vec{k}(\theta_k) \cdot \vec{r} + 
	\phi(\theta_k) - i \omega t}
\end{equation}
Here each monochromatic wave of wavenumber $k$ travels in direction $\theta$ with 
energy $S(\theta)^2 d\theta$ and phase $\phi(\theta)$. Now time dependence is dropped and all 
physical quantities are given by corresponding complex amplitudes. The statement can be 
reformulated in terms of Fourier transform \citep{munk1963directional}. Recall Jacobi-Anger 
expansion,
\begin{equation}
p(r, \theta) = e^{i \vec{k}(\theta) \cdot \vec{r}} = \sum_{m = -\infty}^{m = \infty} i^{m} J_{m}(k 
r) e^{im(\theta - \theta_k)}
\end{equation}
that shows a field at point $(r, \theta)$ produced by plane wave can be expanded in series of 
Bessel functions and circular functions. Then substitution produces
\begin{equation}
\label{C1:p.eq}
p(r, \theta) = \sum_{m=-\infty}^{m=\infty} J_m(kr) e^{im(\theta + \pi/2)} \Big\{ \int_0^{2\pi}  
d\theta_k 
S(\theta_k) 
e^{i\phi(\theta_k)} e^{-im\theta_k} \Big\}
\end{equation}
Term in brackets represent convolution integrals defining circular Fourier coefficients of 
order $m,~A_m - i B_m$. Series \eqref{C1:p.eq} state an inverse problem that seeks the 
unknown coefficients from the known, measured pressure field that is sampled at a set of points 
$(r_i, \theta_i)$ and if infinite series is truncated at some order $N$. Real and imaginary parts 
constitute two separate problems.\\
The same steps are undertaken for velocities as plane wave polarization relations 
\citep[e.g.,][]{muller2000scattering} are utilized. The following is found
\begin{align}
\label{C1:uv.eq}
\begin{Bmatrix}
u \\ v
\end{Bmatrix}
= \frac{1}{2} \sum_{m = -N}^{m = N} J_{m} (kr) e^{im(\theta + \pi/2)}
\begin{Bmatrix}
(\omega - f) A_{m + 1} + (\omega + f) A_{m - 1} - i [(\omega - f) B_{m + 1} + (\omega + f) B_{m - 
	1}] \\ 
(\omega - f) B_{m + 1} - (\omega + f) B_{m - 1} + i [ (\omega - f) A_{m + 1} - (\omega + f) A_{m - 
	1}]
\end{Bmatrix}
\end{align}
The dependence of currents on wave bearing causes splitting of Fourier coefficients. To describe 
velocity field higher circular harmonics have to be used. Or physically, currents have higher 
spatial wavenumber. As well \eqref{C1:uv.eq} emphasizes an asymmetry between clockwise 
and counterclockwise motions due to the Coriolis effect. Now formally the inverse problem can be stated 
\begin{equation}
y = K x
\end{equation}
where $y$ is comprised of measured dynamical variables, $K$ combines bracketed terms in 
\eqref{C1:p.eq} and \eqref{C1:uv.eq} and $x$ are the unknown Fourier coefficients. Generally, the 
problem is over-determined (i.e., number of unknowns is smaller than number of 
measurements) and unstable to small errors in data, so the model yields physically inconsistent 
results. This is circumvented by seeking a damped least square solution \citep{munk2009ocean} where 
a minimization function is 
\begin{equation}
\label{C1:Tikh_prob}
J = ||K x - y||^2_2 + \alpha ||x||^2_2
\end{equation}
The unknown regularization parameter $\alpha$ acts as a high-pass filter in a singular value 
decomposition of $K$ \citep{bennett1992inverse}. In field studies this is usually set by a 
signal-to-noise ratio \citep{munk2009ocean}, since the parameter scales noise variance (residue) 
to actual signal's strength. To obtain $\alpha$ in data-driven way a straightforward approach is 
adapted that based on 
trade-off curve method \citep{hansen1993use}. In \eqref{C1:Tikh_prob} amount of allowed error 
competes with solution's variance. An optimal parameter is said to balance these factors. This is 
seen as a rapid change in behavior of a curve that relate residue with model's norm as amount of regularization varies. In most cases the curve has a sharp corner connecting aforementioned limits, hence, the 
method's name is a L-curve \citep{hansen1999curve}. And the corner is thought to occur for an 
optimal regularization parameter.\\
In the presented here analysis the equations \eqref{C1:p.eq} and \eqref{C1:uv.eq} are sampled at locations along concentric 
arrays placed at $\lambda,~0.5\lambda,~0.25\lambda$ where $\lambda$ is mode-1 wavelength found in the central point. This clearly assumes uniformity of the wave field over sampling window. The footprint could be changed to accommodate some spatial variability, but only in expanse of resolving power. Further, at each location $u,~v,~p$ from the numerical simulations are used as input data and for the central point of the array Fourier coefficients are found. The results are then used in reconstructions over an angular sector to obtain elemental components in the respective grid point.

\subsection{Derivation of conversion from the first principles}
\label{C3.app:B}
While \eqref{C3.eq:conv} provides a convenient way to quantify energy transformations, it does 
not have much room for physical interpretation. Such as in complicated situation when along with 
local baroclinic tide production a remote signal is present. The resultant perturbation of bottom 
pressure might lead to rather ambiguous result of internal tide destruction. It is said that such 
regime is to occur when a phase difference between $w_{bt}$ and $p_{1}$ is in range of 
$(\pi/2,~3\pi/2)$. This is understood as an internal tide performing work against barotropic 
forcing. Unfortunately, this statement does not directly follow from \eqref{C3.eq:conv}. Hence, to 
provide cleaner physical picture, let derive the expression for conversion rate from the first 
principles. Body force of \citep{baines1982internal}, $F_B$ is performing work by displacing 
isopycnal 
surfaces throughout a water column,
\begin{equation}
\label{C3:eq.convd1}
C(z) = \frac{dW(z)}{dt} = F_{B} w_{bc} = \frac{N^2 (-\vec{u} \cdot \nabla h) z}{i \omega h} 
\frac{d 
\xi}{dt} = \frac{w_{bt}}{i \omega h} \frac{z d(-b)}{dt} = -\frac{1}{h} w_{bt} zb
\end{equation}
where isopycnal displacements $\xi$ were changed to buoyancy, $b = -N^2 \xi$ and temporal 
variation 
was assumed to be harmonic, $\sim e^{i \omega t}$. At the final step, integration by parts can be 
employed as,
\begin{equation}
\label{C3:eq.convd2}
\int_{-h}^{0} z b dz = \int_{-h}^{0} z d \big( \int^0_{z} b dz \big) = \big( z \int^0_{z} b dz 
\big)\big|_{-h}^0 - \int_{-h}^{0} dz \int_{z}^{0} b dz^{\prime} = h (\int_{-h}^{0}b dz - 
\frac{1}{h} \int_{-h}^{0} dz \int_{z}^{0} b dz^{\prime})
\end{equation}
The last expression is a bottom pressure perturbation. Noteworthy, the baroclinicity condition was 
not employed. Combining \eqref{C3:eq.convd1} and \eqref{C3:eq.convd2}, familiar result 
for conversion rate is obtained. Note that similar approach to \eqref{C3:eq.convd1} was used 
by \citep{nash2006structure} to estimate an upper limit on emitted energy.\\
