\section*{Abstract}
The Macquarie Ridge south of New Zealand is a strong generator of internal tidal waves forming a 
baroclinic tidal beam. The beam generation takes place in a complex bathymetric region that is 
compared to resonant generation that occurs in Luzon Strait. Local oceanographic conditions are 
highly variable due to presence of the southern subtropical front. These factors produce 
variability in the generation that was studied by numerical simulations initialized with realistic 
hydrographic conditions. Investigation's main goal was to compliment a field program, Tasman 
TIdal dissipation Experiment, directed towards documenting fate of the tidal beam. The numerical 
simulations yielded a mean value of $1.8~GW$ of barotropic $M_2$ energy was converted into a 
largely mode-1 baroclinic field, with variability of $\pm 15\%$(1.4 and 2 GW). The changes were 
concentrated at a topographic gap in the ridge and result from remote 
baroclinic waves emitted by the Campbell Plateau. Direct analysis of the wave field was 
complicated by interference from multiple wave sources. The complexity was eliminated by a novel 
decomposition technique. The wave field is resolved into directional spectra found as solution to 
an inverse problem. The spectral representation allowed for the quantification of the magnitude and 
arrival time of the remote waves, emphasizing their in-phase relation with barotropic forcing and 
thus, enhanced generation.\\

Amplification strongly depends on the three-dimensional structure of the remote waves rather than 
along two-dimensional transect arrival time usually associated with the resonant condition. Hence, 
complexity of the problem increases as there is a strong feedback and coupling between generation 
at the eastern side of the Macquarie ridge and the Campbell Plateau. In the numerical experiments 
alteration of the remote wave was induced by variable phase speeds and stratification, i.e. 
position of the front, and consequent triggering of changes in the conversion. The water mass 
distribution as well governed transmission of remote wave energy across the ridge. These dynamical 
processes brought about variability in the generation and tidal beam intensity that can cause 
intermittency in far field, many mode-1 wavelengths away and can affect field observations such as 
TTIDE.

\section{Introduction}
Baroclinic semidiurnal tides originate from heaving of isopycnal surfaces driven by a strong 
barotropic flow across topographic relief. This process scatters barotropic tidal 
energy into baroclinic motions \citep{hendershott1981long}, constitutes a 
third of global budget for lunar semidiurnal constituent \citep{egbert2000significant, 
munk1997once} and contributes significantly to internal wave climate \citep{wunsch1975deep} and 
interior ocean mixing. At most conversion sites because of highly inclined slopes, the radiated 
internal waves of tidal period (internal tides) have vertical wavenumber spectrum dominated by 
highly stable low mode \citep{st2002role} able to transmit tidal energy over ocean basin-scale 
distances \citep{zhao2016global} with yet unknown fate. While generation sites have been identified 
\citep{morozov1995semidiurnal, simmons2004internal, arbic2010concurrent} and some have been 
studied in detail, e.g. Hawaii Islands \citep{rudnick2003tides}, Luzon Strait 
\citep{klymak2011breaking}, Mendocino Escarpment \citep{althaus2003internal}, the Bay of Biscal 
\citep{gerkema2004internal}, and analytical models have been developed \citep{garrett2007internal}, 
there is still large uncertainty about variability in the conversion and its dynamical reasons.\\

The variability can simply arise as ocean state changes. Water column stratification directly 
impacts internal wave dispersion and generation. In fact, the analytical models of generation 
emphasize a ratio between angle of internal wave characteristics to bathymetric slope (referred to 
as slope's criticality, \citep{sutherland2010internal, garrett2007internal} along with a height of 
topography as primary 
quantities in setting conversion levels \citep{llewellyn2003tidal, petrelis2006tidal}. For tall, 
steeply inclined submarine ridges the energy transfer approaches an upper theoretical limit 
\citep{petrelis2006tidal, st2003generation} making them ``oases" of barotropic tide 
scattering and internal tide production \citep{morozov1995semidiurnal, egbert2000significant}. 
Clearly, the energy rates are modulated by changing buoyancy frequency 
\citep{holloway1999internal}, especially when transformation of water properties happens at same 
depths as the steepest bottom gradients \citep{gerkema2004internal}. Nevertheless, in later field 
studies it was realized that presence of external baroclinic tidal signal leads to even larger 
temporal variability \citep{Kelly2010a, zilberman2011incoherent, pickering2015structure}. This 
might occur as opposite ridge slopes affect each other \citep{nash2004internal, 
zilberman2011incoherent, echeverri2010internal} or due to spatially inhomogeneous distribution of 
production hotspots \citep{osborne2011spatial, ponte2013coastal}, or as separate topographic 
features mediate each others generation energy levels \citep{xing1998three, buijsman2012modeling, 
buijsman2014three, klymak2013parameterizing}. The present investigation addresses 
temporal and spatial variability of internal tide generation happening at the Macquarie Ridge, 
south from 
New Zealand. The Tasman Sea geometry \fignmp{C3:fig:geo.map} suggests that 
location and characteristics of major sea bottom features lead to complex internal tide regime with 
potential similarities to well-studied Kaena Ridge and Luzon Strait.\\

The Macquarie Ridge is scatterer of barotropic energy with the radiated waves forming a baroclinic 
tidal beam \citep{zhao2016global, zhao2018satellite}. Its fate was a subject of a recent field 
program, TTIDE \citep{pinkel2015breaking} and one of the goals of the present investigation 
was to compliment the observations with numerical simulations. The beam generation is complicated 
because of the neighboring Campbell Plateau. It is possible that similarly to Luzon Strait, 
constructive interference of the radiated waves at generation sites can substantially amplify 
energy transfer from barotropic tide \citep{buijsman2012double, echeverri2010internal}. In turn, 
this can affect magnitude of the beam and far-field observations. Oceanographic conditions present 
additional difficulties as the Macquarie Ridge is found in region of convergence between 
subtropical (STW) and 
subpolar (SAW) water masses 
\citep{chiswell2015physical}. 
The zone is bounded by two fronts delimited with surface isohalines of $35.1$ and $34.7$ 
\citep{belkin, hamilton} \fignmp{C3:fig:geo.map}. The Southern Substropical Front 
(S-STF) defines the poleward extent of STW and has strong signature in the upper 100-200 m. The 
associated geostrophic current is weak because of strong density compensation. But topographic 
steering by the ridge produce meanders of S-STF that can result in eddy shedding 
\citep{smith2013interaction}. Mesoscale variability is also induced by atmospheric cyclones and 
local winds causing front filamentation \citep{james}. On synoptic scales there is a possible 
migration of up to $1^{\circ}$ meridionally \citep{smith} in response to a seasonal cycle of 
insolation and strength of the westerlies.\\

The primary goal of this study was to describe effect of the complex internal wave field on the 
generation of the tidal beam and how the dynamics evolves in response to the changing oceanographic 
conditions. These problems were investigated by means of numerical simulations that include 
baroclinic tide dynamics and variable, realistic hydrographic conditions (Section). General 
characteristics of the generation were delineated (). Then primary mechanism of amplification was 
identified and its connection to the remote internal waves was firmly established () by application 
of a novel decomposition technique (). This allowed for complete description of how generation 
is governed by three-dimensional wave field, dependent upon the ocean conditions (). To conclude, 
effect of the discussed dynamical factors were quantitatively related to the conversion levels and 
hence, intensity of the tidal beam ().\\

\section{Numerical experiments and analysis}
\subsection{Numerical experiments}
To study variability of internal tide generation around New Zealand and its propagation numerical 
simulations were performed with Regional Ocean Modeling System \citep{shchepetkin2005regional}. 
The numerical domain covered the southern Tasman Sea from subantractic waters of $60^{\circ}$ S 
to subtropics in $35^{\circ}$ S. And the zonal extent stretched from $142^{\circ}$ to $172^{\circ}$ 
E. This ensued correct representation of rich regional oceanographic conditions. The horizontal 
grid spacing was taken to be of $1/32^{\circ}$ corresponding on average to discretization of 3 km 
in zonal direction and 2.5 km in meridional. The nonuniformly separated, vertical 50 $s$-levels 
were placed to smoothly follow subsurface terrain.\\
Such discretization of vertical momentum equation tends to induce artificial, horizontal  
along-slope flows \citep{haidvogel1999numerical} due to errors in reproducing of pressure 
gradient force. Especially severe errors are made by steep terrain. The misbehavior is usually 
resolved by artificial smoothing of topography. This procedure additionally increases numerical 
stability, but has an adverse effect on internal tide generation \citep{di2006numerical} since 
primary production sites are collocated with large topographic gradients. To test the numerical 
setup, a sensitivity study was carried out with simulations of 
$1/8^{\circ},~1/16^{\circ},~1/64^{\circ}$ horizontal resolution. The essential for this study 
internal tide behavior manifested at $1/16^{\circ}$ and converged for $1/32^{\circ}$ and 
$1/64^{\circ}$ cases. There no marked differences were observed, except a substantial increase in 
high mode content which is in line with \footnote{previous investigations} 
\citep{di2006numerical}.\\
(bad transition)This work addresses the gravest baroclinic mode dynamics in the deep ocean. Spatial 
extent of 
waves is large compared to associated vertical displacements. This ensures linear regime of 
propagation without dispersive and nonhydrostatic effects taken place such as fission into 
solitons. A hydrostatic solver used in ROMS seems to be a proper choice for the simulations. Such 
simplification in wave dynamics was assumed in previous studies \citep{carter2008energetics, 
merrifield2001generation,  merrifield2002model, kerry2013effects}. In more dynamically accurate   
simulations of \citep{kang2012energetics, zhang2011three} the nonhydrostatic effects are found to 
be important only for internal tides in shallow waters, while for main part generation follows 
linear dynamics with vertical accelerations to have a negligible contribution.\\
The horizontal boundary conditions were imposed to be open for depth-averaged, barotropic flows 
following recommendations of \citep{marchesiello2001open}. The baroclinic fields are 
nudged to zero by linearly increased lateral viscosity and diffusivity over sponge layers. Through 
the same outer boundaries numerical simulations were forced with barotropic tide. The tidal 
currents and sea level are derived from TPXO atlas, version 7.2 \citep{egbert2002efficient} and 
prescibed as linearly interpolated volume transports. It was used only the largest semidiurnal 
constituent $M_2$. Amplitude ratio between the principal lunar and solar components are 4-to-1 
suggestive of slight open-ocean spring-neap modulation. The diurnal species are weak in the region 
except shoals east of New Zealand \citep{walters2001ocean}.\\
To investigate variations of baroclinic tide dynamics several ocean states were prescribed and 
analyzed separately. In the simplest setting lateral gradients in water properties were absent, 
while buoyancy frequency was set to be representative of the Tasman Basin. The second set of 
simulations 
was comprised to investigate interannual and interseasonal variability (Table 1). And the third 
calculation was intended to cover period of TTIDE/TBEAM/Tshelf field programs 
\citep{pinkel2015breaking}, a single experiment once initialized was left to proceed for three 
months.

The simulations with variable conditions were at first initialized with HYCOM hindcasts 
\footnote{(NAVGEM;	downloaded from hycom.org)} for respective start dates. Then during 
integration, 
along with barotropic tidal flow, time-variable, subtidal two dimensional fields 
\footnote{(vertical coordinate and along boundary coordinate)} of horizontal currents, temperature 
and salinity were imposed onto the numerical ocean on the boundaries. Conditions of air-sea 
interface obtained from MERRA-reanalysis \citep{rienecker2011merra} were as well utilized to 
prescribe realistic insolation, air temperature, EP rates and most importantly, wind stresses.

\subsection{Internal tide analysis}
As seen in \tblnm{ch2:table_exp} the simulations were carried out for 15 days or longer. In all 
cases the first 10 days were regarded as spin up of baroclinic tide generation and 
propagation. Particularly it accommodated a single passage of mode-1 from New Zealand 
to Tasmania that takes roughly 7 days. After the spin-up period three 
dimensional fields of velocity, temperature and salinity were sampled hourly. These 
were subject to high pass filtering with Butterworth filter of order $6$ with cut off time of $36$ 
hours to remove subtidal motions. Left-out signal was further fit in a least square sense to the 
principle semidiurnal harmonic. Then the three dimensional fields 
underwent a separation into barotropic and baroclinic signals \citep{cummins1997simulation, 
kunze2002internal, carter2008energetics}. A depth-averaged current is thought to represent a pure 
barotropic signal and any vertical deviation is attributed to a baroclinic wave,
\begin{equation}
\label{ch2:bt_bc_vel}
\vec{u}_{bt}(x,y) = \frac{1}{H} \int_{-H}^{0} \vec{u}(x,y,z)  dz,~\vec{u}_{bc}(x,y,z) =  
\vec{u}(x,y,z) - \vec{u}_{bt}(x,y)
\end{equation}
To obtain distribution of pressure, at first, the linear equation of state and respective 
\textit{TS}-fields are used to determine density perturbations. At second, via the hydrostatic 
approximation consequent vertical integration leads to total pressure field. This 
is then subject to baroclinicity condition, stating that baroclinic pressure anomaly associated 
with internal tides is taken to be a deviation from the depth-averaged,
\begin{equation}
\label{ch2:bt_bc_pres}
p(x,y,z) = \int_{-z}^{0} \rho(x,y,z) dz,~p_{bc}(x,y) = p(x,y,z) - \frac{1}{H} \int_{-H(x,y)}^{0} 
\rho(x,y,z) dz
\end{equation}
In the both expressions rigid-lid approximation is used. This is a valid assumption unless 
vertical accelerations are greater than acceleration due to gravity \citep{kelly2010}.\\
Vertical distribution of each dynamical variable was then decomposed into vertical modes. The 
structure functions were 
obtained from local Brunt-Vaisala frequency profiles found from time-averaged density fields. 
These were used in Sturm-Liouville problem under the hydrostatic approximation,
\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dz}\Big( \frac{1}{N^2}  \frac{d \psi(z)}{dz}\Big) + c^{-2}_n \psi(z) 
= 0
\end{equation}
where $c_n$ is the mode phase speed in non-rotating ocean. The first 3 eigenmode structural 
function obtained per each numerical grid point were used to describe respective vertical 
distribution in the dynamical fields. And further presented results focus only on mode-1 energetics 
as of its primary importance.\\
Here the low mode is characterized by period-averaged rates of conversion from barotropic tide to 
baroclinic \citep{simmons2004internal, kurapov2003m}, depth-averaged energy flux, horizontal 
kinetic energy (HKE) and available potential energy (APE) that were found as
\begin{align}
\label{C3.eq:conv}
C_{bt\to 1} = -\frac{1}{2}(\cj{\vec{u}_{bt}} \cdot \nabla H) p_{1}|_{z = -H(x,y)}\\
\vec{F} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{H} \cj{\vec{u}_1} p_1 \int_{-H}^{0} \psi_1(z) \psi_1(z) dz\\
HKE = \frac{1}{2} \rho_0 \cj{\vec{u}_1} \vec{u}_1 \int_{-H}^{0} \psi_1(z) \psi_1(z) dz\\
APE = \frac{1}{2c_1^2} \rho_0 \cj{p_1} {p}_1 \int_{-H}^{0} \psi_1(z) \psi_1(z) dz
\end{align}
The coefficient $\frac{1}{2}$ appears due to time averaging and because signals are represented by 
complex number notation.\\

The mode-1 internal tide field was additionally subject to directional analysis in order to 
extract signals associated with the tidal beam. The details are presented in appendix 
\ref{C3.app:A1} and summarized as follows. Dynamical fields of pressure and currents sampled over 
finite number of grid points can be described by directional 
spectra. Its circular Fourier 
transform is then obtained as solution by damped least squares of an ill-posed inverse problem. The 
spectral, directional analysis is different from the approach of \cite{zhao2010long} for two main 
reasons. The underlying inverse model equations \eqref{C1:p.eq} produce simultaneous fit to all 
compass directions, rather than a finite number of plane waves. This makes a difference in regions 
where wave diffraction prevails. For instance, wave field near sites of internal tide generation or 
scattering will be comprised by angular distribution of energy confined to diffractive lobes 
\citep[e.g.,][]{munroe2005topographic, johnston2003internal} rather than a single plane wave. On 
the other hand, because of finite-window sampling artificial lobes are introduced as in classical 
Fourier analysis. The analysis artifacts lead to unambiguous interpretation, so judgment should be 
used when wave fields are back-synthesized over sampling angular sectors. Secondary, 
velocity measurements are utilized along with pressure observations \eqref{C1:uv.eq}. The 
formulation provides additional constrain on the model. Indeed, the velocity equations tend to 
lessen Gibbs phenomena. More importantly, fitting of directional spectra to current and pressure 
observations can be rewritten for point-wise measurements such as a stationary mooring.\\

All of the above calculations produced sets of dynamical variables for barotropic, baroclinic 
fields and directional representations of the gravest mode for each experiment. To study 
variability in the generation, mean energy characteristics were defined by simple arithmetic mean 
(ensemble-mean) and range of variability - by standard deviation. Such definitions have a caveat. 
While ensemble-mean allows a straightforward interpretation of mode-1 dynamics, it will incorporate 
a portion of variable (non-stationary) signal since any energy characteristic is a nonlinear 
quantity \citep{zaron2014time}. On contrary, energy flux, for instance, found from ensemble-mean 
pressure and currents will exclusively provide a stationary part. Yet if a mode-decomposed signal 
is considered, finding the means will entail averaging of vertical basis functions. As a 
consequence, their orthogonality will not be preserved leading to uncertainty in dynamics. 
Performed comparison (not shown) between an ensemble-mean of flux and a flux of ensemble-mean did 
not reveal significant differences in spatial structure, though energy of ensemble-mean signals was 
smaller. 

\section{Results}
\subsection{Internal tide production}
The semidiurnal barotropic tide propagates into the Southern Tasman Sea from the North 
\fignmp{C3.fig:BT}. Its phase increases in counterclockwise manner with maximum amplitude of sea 
level located along New Zealand's coast, the behavior typical of Kelvin wave 
\citep{walters2001ocean}. 
The strong tidal phenomena is also observed in shallow Bass Strait, but relatively weak anywhere 
else in the basin. The simulated sea surface tidal oscillation closely follows TPXO7.2 with gross 
features well captured. But the sea level magnitude and cotidal (phase) lines exhibit wave-like, 
small scale perturbations. This is a manifestation of low-mode baroclinic waves 
\fignmp{C3.fig:beam}. The baroclinic tidal field appears as a complex pattern produced by 
multiple generation sites defined by steep topographic relief. The primary sites are just south of 
New Zealand. Here the barotropic Kelvin wave faces the Macquarie Ridge stretched for 2000 km. As 
the barotropic current decays away from the coastline baroclinic tide production decreases as well. 
But low-mode beams are emitted from many locations. Henceforth, analysis concerns the 
most energetic beam emitted from a hotspot at $49.5^{\circ}$ which hereinafter referred to as the 
Macquarie Ridge.\\

The major beam is produced by conversion of the barotropic tidal currents impinging on 
supercritical bathymetry \fignmp{C3.fig:gen}. The depth of the strongest generation lies between 
1000-3000 m and spatially confined to two seamounts that are separated with a gap. This valley 
topography is deeper and has more gradual slopes, so it should play a secondary role in production 
of the tidal beam. But from distribution of conversion rates \fignmlp[C3.fig:gen]{b} and its 
spatial averages \fignmlp[C3.fig:gen]{c} a different perspective emerges. Generation at the gap 
makes up a significant portion of the converted energy and displays unusually high variability in 
magnitude. Degree of spatial variation within averaging regions is much smaller. But the generation 
pattern rearranges between the experiments. The production can diminish in the gap and peak value 
move into the northern or southern part of the ridge.\\

The Macquarie ridge on average converts $1.8 \pm 0.2~GW$ of the surface tide into mode-1 
baroclinic tide. This is a half of production at Kaena Ridge, Hawaii \citep{carter2008energetics} 
and tenfold smaller than Luzon Strait \citep{alford2011energy, kerry2014impact}. But similar to 
Luzon Strait the Macquarie ridge features complex internal tide dynamics that is manifested as 
regions of negative conversion (green shading, \fignml[C3.fig:gen]{b}). It is known 
\citep{Kelly2010a} that such reverse energy transfer and destruction of internal tide is driven by 
coupling with remote baroclinic waves. In fact, oppositely located slopes of the Campbell Plateau 
(Auckland Escarpment) provides a source of such signal. Further interference creates a standing 
wave \fignmp{C3.fig:stand_wave}. Its presence is evident in the distribution of HKE marked by a 
node in the middle of Solander trough. Additionally, around the node energy flux forms a circular 
pattern \fignmp{C3.fig:stand_wave} with counterclockwise progression since Coriolis parameter is 
negative in the Southern Hemisphere.\\

By the directional method (appendix \ref{C3.app:A1}) the standing wave is separated 
into elemental east-west oriented components \fignmlp[C3.fig:stand_wave]{b, c}. On the leeward side 
of the Macquarie Ridge generation takes place at the same seamounts but there is a region of 
destruction that coincides with incidence of waves emitted from the escarpment. On the trough's 
opposite side generation has richer structure both due to more complicated topography and 
barotropic forcing \fignmlp[A]{C3.fig:BT}, but also due to effect of the Macquarie ridge waves on 
the local generation. Respective energy transfer across the trough was quantified and compared with 
spatially integrated conversion rates \fignmlp[C3.fig:stand_wave]{d}. On average, energy in each 
elemental wave field is almost equally divided amongst waves reflected from the supercritical 
slopes and wave energy derived from the barotropic field. Though the system exhibits large 
departures from the average state due to variable conditions of the coupling on the slopes.\\

The obtained internal tide description is similar to Luzon strait where resonance conditions exist 
between two almost parallel ridges \citep{buijsman2012double, buijsman2014three} separated by a 
distance of 0.6 mode-1 wavelength. In the case of the Macquarie Ridge and the Campbell Plateau 
resonance should be weaker since the former has an orientation of $15^{\circ}$ relative to the 
latter. As well the separation distance at $49.5^{\circ}$ is 3/4 of mode-1 wavelength. These 
parameters suggest relevance of wave's travel-time to the observed variability in baroclinic tide 
production levels and its spatial pattern. To examine this the internal tide dynamics is further 
studied along a two-dimensional transect crossing the gap (horizontal line on 
\fignml[C3.fig:gen]{b}) in simulations with diametrically different generation regimes (\sqm{2014} 
and \sqm{d10-15, 2015}, \fignml[C3.fig:gen]{c}, \fignmlp[C3.fig:stand_wave]{d}). Consequent 
results are similar to findings of \citep{echeverri2010internal, buijsman2012double} with 
exception that here the decomposition method augments description of variations in mode-1 wave 
field.\\

\subsection{Amplification mechanism}
Vertically integrated conversion rate (\ref{C3.eq:conv}) quantifies how much work was done by the 
baroptropic tide in displacing isopycnal interfaces against buoyant forces throughout a water 
column\footnote{Following this concept a derivation from the first principles is provided in 
appendix \ref{C3.app:B} \citep[see also]{kurapov2003m, kelly2010topo}.}. It is recognized 
that the barotropic forcing might be oppositely directed to vertical motions if somewhere in the 
water column other processes take place. For case of \sqm{2014} simulation 
\fignmlp[C3.fig:gen_2d]{a, b} during ebb tide on the tideward side (solid black line, 
$164.2^{\circ}$) there is vertically net energy conversion into the baroclinic field 
\fignmlp[C3.fig:gen_2d]{e}. But note along the bottom an internal wave ray is developing as 
isopycnals lift following preceding flooding stage. Hence, at this location and depths the locally 
generated internal wave does work against the downward barotropic flow and the contribution is 
increasing with time. At about hour 7 on \fignml[C3.fig:gen_2d]{E} the net conversion becomes 
negative, but then flips sign as the tidal current reverses direction \fignmlp[C3.fig:gen_2d]{B}. 
Averaged over tidal period the transfer is positive, i.e. the surface tide losses energy, but weak 
compare to \sqm{d10-15} simulation \fignmlp[C3.fig:gen_2d]{C-D}. This experiment demonstrates 
amplification of production on the gap's slope due to presence of the remotely generated internal 
tide. Its propagation from Solander Trough ($165^{\circ}$) and across the gap is the major 
difference between the two. In \sqm{d10-15} along slope formation of an internal wave is still 
found, but now due to the shoaling mode-1, conversion is positive throughout the full tidal cycle. 
In summary, the remote signal supports positive energy transfer during periods of tidal current 
reversals, so that excess of energy is drawn from the surface tide into the baroclinic field 
\fignmlp[C3.fig:gen_2d]{E}.\\

Phase lag between localized barotropic forcing and remote, incident signal is a 
crucial parameter in describing the system dynamics which is illustrated on the leeward side (black 
dashed line, $164.5^{\circ}E$). Here the vertical barotropic flow is opposite to the previous 
situation. For \sqm{d10-15} the traveling mode-1 internal tide is losing energy as it displaces 
isopycnals oppositely to the forcing. In actuality, mode-1 reflection takes place as an internal 
wave ray is emitted towards the trough. The associated baroclinic currents are easterly downward, 
same direction as group speed \fignmlp[C3.fig:gen_2d]{C-D}. In \sqm{2014} the along slope current 
is opposite, coinciding with the isopycnal displacements and the flow of barotropic tide. Thus, in 
both cases the energy propagates downward and away from the slope, but the corresponding phases are 
$180^{\circ}$-shifted denoting either reflection of the internal tide or unobstructed generation 
respectively \fignml[C3.fig:gen_2d]{E}. The period-averaged conversion rates further highlight the 
differences \fignmlp[C3.fig:gen_2d]{F}. Overall, the simulations demonstrate three distinct cases 
of energy transfer between barotropic and baroclinic modes on a sloping bottom and pathway taken 
is driven by the remote wave. Its influence is further demonstrated by exploring phase distribution 
along the section \fignmlp[C3.fig:gen_2d]{g} in mode-1 pressure field.\\

Phase of the superposed, total wave shows a stagnant region eastward from of $165^{\circ}E$ that 
corresponds to the node in HKE \fignmlp[C3.fig:stand_wave]{A}. As before the decomposition reveals 
it as a sum of the ridge-generated waves (eastward) and the escarpment-originated waves (westward). 
West of $165^{\circ}E$ there is almost a free propagation in \sqm{d10-15} of the ``escarpment" 
waves as the total signal is similar, though some eastward contribution is present as a result of 
the reflection. At the previously considered locations mode-1 phase is above $-90^{\circ}$ which 
results respectively in enhancement or destruction on the opposite gap's sides. Note that the 
phases are referenced relative to the barotropic flow on the tideward side. In \sqm{'2014'} on the 
leeward side the total signal is mostly described by the eastward waves and the phase tends to 
$-180^{\circ}$, hence, the wave is mainly related to the local generation. On the tideward side 
both signals are in the same quadrature as the local barotropic flow, but in \sqm{'d10-15'} there 
is a twenty-fold increase in production levels associated not only with higher bottom pressure, but 
also because of small phase lag with the barotropic forcing.

\section{Discussion on Variability}
\subsection{Three dimensional structure of the wave fields}
Generation at the gap strongly depends on magnitude and phase of the incident, westward wave. 
Thus, the variability in conversion is linked to three dimensional structure of the wave field. 
This is illustrated by \fignm{C3.fig:wv_fld_dist} where the results of the decomposition are shown 
for three experiments. In case of \sqm{2014} the westward wave is weak due to reduced generation at 
the Campbell Plateau (see also \fignml[C3.fig:gen]{C}). More importantly, lines of constant phase 
are slanted relative to the Macquarie Ridge leading to insignificant energy flux across the gap. In 
contrast, for \sqm{d10-15} there is substantially more cross-ridge energy flux. Note that the 
dynamical state is not permanent as adjustments in the incident wave field bring new changes such 
as seen in the results three weeks later, \sqm{d35-40} \fignmlp[C3.fig:wv_fld_dist]{C}. The 
incidence has changed and the wave arrives later driving more intense generation at the gap as well 
as the ridge.\\

The westward wave field is defined by dynamics occurring on the slopes of the Campbell Plateau 
where reflection couples with local generation. In these experiments it is characterized by highly 
variable spatial pattern of generation/destruction. For \sqm{2014} there is a strong destruction 
evident near $(166.5E, 48.75S)$, \fignmlp[C3.fig:wv_fld_dist]{A}, while in the other cases 
magnitude 
of energy loss is smaller. The location corresponds to impingement of an eastward traveling wave 
produced at the Macquarie 
Ridge \fignmlp[C3.fig:wv_fld_dist]{bottom row}. And its phase lag relative to local barotropic tide 
is a primary factor. That is, earlier arrival such as in \sqm{d10-15} and 
\sqm{d35-40} corresponds to weak energy losses and overall higher production rates 
\fignmlp[C3.fig:gen]{C}.\\

It is straightforward to establish a relation between the phase of the eastward waves and mode-1 
eigenspeed under extreme conditions. For example, \sqm{2014}-experiment exhibits $15\%$ slower 
progression, i.e. a $\sim 20^{\circ}$ or $40$ minute later arrival. The same holds for 
\sqm{uniform}-experiment where higher phase speed leads to much earlier arrival and very strong 
enhancement (compare \fignml[C3.fig:gen]{B} with \fignml[C3.fig:wv_fld_dist]{A-C}). But in the 
cases of modest anomaly, such interpretation becomes complicated with initial 
phase of the eastward waves. The field emitted by the northern seamount of the 
Macquarie Ridge initially have phase of about $0^{\circ}$ in \sqm{d10-15}, while in \sqm{d35-40} - 
$\sim 50^{\circ}$. In turn, the difference arises from variable incidence and arrival of the 
westward waves. Their characteristic strongly depends on complicated pattern of multiple site 
generation/reflection at the Campbell Plateau rather than anomaly in phase speed. This is contrary 
to the 
eastward waves that are produced by much simpler generation pattern. And since the phase lines 
closely repeat the emitting seamount's topography, a plane wave description is fairly appropriate 
and hence, facilitates linear phase dependence on inverse of the phase speed.\\

Accordingly, phase speed and stratification change should be thought as a triggering mechanism for 
adjustments in the generation patterns. To illustrate this, hydrographic conditions are presented 
on \fignm{C3.fig:ocean_cond}. For the region sea surface salinity draws distinction between warmer 
subtropical waters (STW is seen by brighter colors on the figure) and fresher subantarctic waters 
(SAW - colder color) and is well representative of the upper water column characteristics. As 
consequence, there is a strong correspondence with phase speed anomalies 
\fignmlp[C3.fig:wv_fld_dist]{lower panels}. This is further exemplified for two locations. In the 
first case it is observed development of a frontal filament following a passage of atmospheric 
cyclone \fignmlp[C3.fig:ocean_cond]{B, C}. The advected STW produced stronger pycnocline in the 
upper 
200 m (\fignm{C3.fig:ocean_cond} lower panels designated by '1', blue and green lines) and positive 
phase speed anomaly. It is notable that in \sqm{2014} (red line) a mixture of SAW and STW led to 
weaker stratification as there is pronounced density compensation. The second position was chosen 
to illustrate how a warm-core eddy can cause large, localized deviations from the mean 
\fignmlp[C3.fig:wv_fld_dist]{D}. A weak vertical density gradient is present again and 
Brunt-Vaisala frequency is rather small in the upper 100 m. Despite this the eigenspeed is high. 
This is caused by deeper pycnocline ($\sim 1000m$) that separates fresher Antarctica Intermediate 
Water \citep{chiswell2015physical} from the upper ocean. In this experiment the eddy has strong 
saline signature that reinforces the secondary pycnocline, while it exerts higher 
influence on the eigenfunctions. The examples lead to conclusion that presence of STW produce 
positive anomalies, while opposite is true for SAW. And the converging water masses has 
direct effect on the internal tide kinematics.

\subsection{Energy levels}
The presented evidences state importance of feedback mechanism between the generation on the 
opposing slopes of Solanders trough in controlling production of the internal tidal beam. It 
also seems that stationary regime can be hardly observed. Changes in stratification and phase 
speeds control respective lags in the arrival times to affect coupling with the barotropic tide and 
strength of the westward waves.\\

This conclusion is qualitatively illustrated by \fignml[C3.fig:gen_dynamics]{A, B}. Variability of 
generation at the gap explains $75\%$ of variability in the overall production at the Macquarie 
ridge. While the generation by the gap is mainly related to strength of the incident, westward 
wave. In this case its amplitude is quantified as integral of energy flux across red line on 
\fignmlp[C3.fig:wv_fld_dist]{F} and given by black line on \fignml[C3.fig:gen_dynamics]{B}. 
Correlation 
coefficient between the generation and the flux is $R^2 = 50\%$, but if \sqm{uniform}-experiment is 
excluded, $R^2$ rises to $80\%$. The \sqm{uniform} experiment is an outlier as uniformly prescribed 
stratification typical of the deep Tasman basin led to unrealistically high phase speeds in the 
Macquarie ridge region. The westward wave arrived in-phase with the local barotropic tide on the 
lee side of the ridge and out-phase on the western side \fignmlp[C3.fig:gen]{B}. This regime is 
clearly opposite to other experiments \fignmlp[C3.fig:gen]{C}.\\

Direct effect of variable stratification on the generation has also to be investigated because of 
highly dynamical ocean environment. To account for this, an analytical model 
\citep{st2003generation} is 
applied. The 
ridge is thought to be a two-dimensional knife-edge 
topography whose height is found from the topography's mean depth in WKB-scaled vertical coordinate 
\citep{althaus2003internal} relative to the abyssal depth. The knife-edge barrier is transversely 
stretched for 240 km and is subject to barotropic current of $0.03~m/s$ representative to ROMS 
numerical simulations. Under variable conditions for strongly stratified ocean the knife-edge ridge 
is taller and sheds more baroclinic energy. Surprisingly, the calculation 
\fignmlp[C3.fig:gen_dynamics]{C} identifies converse dependence. The inconsistency is 
resolved by considering effect of stratification on energy transmission across the Macquarie ridge. 
To estimate the transmission coefficient the ridge's height ratio is now obtained relative to 
Solander Trough. Than closed-form solutions of \citep{larsen1969internal} 
\begin{equation}
\label{C3.eq:ke_transm}
R_{knife} = \sin^2 \frac{1}{2} \pi h - \frac{1}{2} P_2( \cos \pi h ) + (\frac{1}{2} - \sin^2 
\frac{1}{2} \pi h) P_1( \cos \pi h ),~
T_{knife} = (1 - R_{knife})^2
\end{equation}
where $P_1,~P_2$ are the Legendre polynomials and $h$ - ratio of depth occupied by the barrier to 
the ocean depth, are applied. The values obtained for each simulation are plotted on 
\fignmlp[C3.fig:gen_dynamics]{A, empty diamonds} and then were used to scale the overall 
incident flux 
(integrated across blue line on \fignml[C3.fig:stand_wave]{C}). \fignml[C3.fig:gen_dynamics]{C} 
suggests the changes in stratification affect ridge's transmission and taller ridge allows less 
across-ridge transport. The result does not exclude the implied role of stratification, but rather 
emphasizes the primary mechanism of amplified generation due to the remote wave.\\

It is apparent that the calculation based on the knife-edge theory is an underestimate. For 
instance, using \eqref{C3.eq:ke_transm} transmission across the gap alone is 
about $15\%$ \fignmlp[C3.fig:gen_dynamics]{B}, but this contradicts largely subcritical 
slope and unobserved change in the mode-1 amplitude \fignmlp[C3.fig:gen_2d]{C-D}. Using the 
decomposition method different values are obtained and given by filled diamonds on 
\fignmlp[C3.fig:gen_dynamics]{A-B}. The estimates seem to be more plausible as the gap alone 
transmits $47 \pm 15~\%$ and the Macquarie ridge - $40 \pm 10~\%$. Nevertheless, these should also 
be taken with a grain of salt as the wave field is not homogeneous breaking the 
underlying assumption of the method. In actuality, if the above estimates are used in the same way 
as the knife-edge calculations, i.e. to produce \fignmlp[C3.fig:gen_dynamics]{D}, no correlation is 
found. Though pertinent feature of this analysis is in similar character of change for the 
differently found transmission coefficients. Thus, dynamical effect of stratification is to control 
across topography wave transport.\\

The topographical transmission properties has direct effect for description of the standing wave in 
the trough. 

There is surprising corespondance The variability is quite notable. Following 
previous section 
it is dictated for 
the gap mainly by the westward wave arrival. The transmission across the seamounts is controlled 
along with the westward wave phase by its incidence and additionally, by ocean stratification.\\

\section{Discussion and Conclusion}
The numerical experiments were performed. This study looked only into generation. The levels are 
variable.
Major points:
There is an enhanced generation as in resonant condition. Strength of the resonance is affected by 
magnitude and phasing of the remote waves. The remote waves are emitted from multiple generation 
sites. Their distribution itself depends on the arrivale of the Macquarie Ridge. This constitutes a 
feedback mechanism. The feedback mechanism is controlled by phase speed distribution, i.e. 
distribution of water masses. The Macquarie Ridge conversion and the tidal beam depends also on 
amount of energy transmitted across the ridge which also seems to dependent on stratification.\\
Q1: Luzon Str var and here - compare in terms of magnitude
Q2: AAIW and Upper Circumpolar Water
It is interesting to compare the results here with a similar study of \citep{kerry2014impact}. They 
reported change of $\pm 20\%$ in energy level of the baroclinic tide was conclusively shown to be 
driven by the aforementioned factors. And major factor was due to remote waves modulated by 
intrusion of Kuroshio.

\subsection{Application of directional spectra to internal tidal fields}
\subsubsection{Antenna analysis}
\label{C3.app:A1}
Similar approaches were used previously in internal tide field programs 
\citep{hendry1977observations, lozovatsky2003spatial} \footnote{that were based on array 
beamforming method and stationarity of the field} or satellite altimetry \citep{dushaw2002mapping} 
or in surface wave studies \citep{longuet1961observations, munk1963directional, long1986inverse}. 
Let pressure in complicated seas to be described by an angular spectrum
\begin{equation}
\label{C1:eq.spectrum}
p(\vec{r}, t) = \int_0^{2\pi}  d\theta_k S(\theta_k) e^{i \vec{k}(\theta_k) \cdot \vec{r} + 
	\phi(\theta_k) - i \omega t}
\end{equation}
Here each monochromatic wave of wavenumber $k$ travels in direction $\theta$ with 
energy $S(\theta)^2 d\theta$ and phase of $\phi(\theta)$. Now time dependence is dropped and all 
physical quantities are given by corresponding complex amplitudes. The statement can be 
reformulated in terms of Fourier transform \citep{munk1963directional}. Recall Jacobi-Anger 
expansion,
\begin{equation}
p(r, \theta) = e^{i \vec{k}(\theta) \cdot \vec{r}} = \sum_{m = -\infty}^{m = \infty} i^{m} J_{m}(k 
r) e^{im(\theta - \theta_k)}
\end{equation}
that shows a field at point $(r, \theta)$ produced by plane wave can be expanded in series of 
Bessel functions and circular functions. Then substitution produces
\begin{equation}
\label{C1:p.eq}
p(r, \theta) = \sum_{m=-\infty}^{m=\infty} J_m(kr) e^{im(\theta + \pi/2)} \Big\{ \int_0^{2\pi}  
d\theta_k 
S(\theta_k) 
e^{i\phi(\theta_k)} e^{-im\theta_k} \Big\}
\end{equation}
Term in brackets represent convolution integrals defining circular Fourier coefficients of 
order $m,~A_m - i B_m$. Series \eqref{C1:p.eq} states an inverse problem that seeks the 
unknown coefficients from the known, measured pressure field that is sampled at a set of points 
$(r_i, \theta_i)$ and if infinite series is truncated at some order $N$. Real and imaginary parts 
will constitute two separate problems.\\
The same steps are undertaken for velocities as plane wave polarization relations 
\citep[e.g.,][]{muller2000scattering} are utilized. The following is found
\begin{align}
\label{C1:uv.eq}
\begin{Bmatrix}
u \\ v
\end{Bmatrix}
= \frac{1}{2} \sum_{m = -N}^{m = N} J_{m} (kr) e^{im(\theta + \pi/2)}
\begin{Bmatrix}
(\omega - f) A_{m + 1} + (\omega + f) A_{m - 1} - i [(\omega - f) B_{m + 1} + (\omega + f) B_{m - 
	1}] \\ 
(\omega - f) B_{m + 1} - (\omega + f) B_{m - 1} + i [ (\omega - f) A_{m + 1} - (\omega + f) A_{m - 
	1}]
\end{Bmatrix}
\end{align}
The dependence of currents on wave bearing causes splitting of Fourier coefficients. To describe 
velocity field higher circular harmonics have to be used. Or physically, velocities have higher 
spatial wavenumber. As well \eqref{C1:uv.eq} emphasize an asymmetry between clockwise 
and counterclockwise motions due to Coriolis effect. Now formally the inverse problem can be stated 
\begin{equation}
y = K x
\end{equation}
where $y$ is comprised of measured dynamical variables, $K$ combines bracketed terms in 
\eqref{C1:p.eq} and \eqref{C1:uv.eq} and $x$ are the unknown Fourier coefficients. Generally, the 
problem is over-determined (i.e., number of unknowns is smaller than number of 
measurements) and unstable to small errors in data, so the model yields physically inconsistent 
results. This is circumvented by seeking a damped least square solution \citep{munk2009ocean} where 
a minimization function is 
\begin{equation}
\label{C1:Tikh_prob}
J = ||K x - y||^2_2 + \alpha ||x||^2_2
\end{equation}
The unknown regularization parameter $\alpha$ acts as a high-pass filter in a singular value 
decomposition of $K$ \citep{bennett1992inverse}. In field studies this is usually set by a 
signal-to-noise ratio \citep{munk2009ocean}, since the parameter scales noise variance (residue) 
to actual signal's strength. To obtain $\alpha$ in data-driven way a straightforward approach is 
adapted that based on 
trade-off curve method \citep{hansen1993use}. In \eqref{C1:Tikh_prob} amount of allowed error 
is competing with solution's variance. An optimal parameter should balance these factors. This is 
seen as a rapid change in behavior of curve associating residue with model's norm as regularization 
varies. In most cases the curve has a sharp corner connecting aforementioned limits, hence, the 
method's name is a L-curve \citep{hansen1999curve}. And the corner is thought to occur for an 
optimal regularization parameter.\\
The equations \eqref{C1:p.eq} and \eqref{C1:uv.eq} are sampled at locations along concentric 
arrays placed at $\lambda,~0.5\lambda,~0.25\lambda$ where $\lambda$ is local mode-1 wavelength. 
At each location $u,~v,~p$ are used as data and for a region embraced by array Fourier coefficients 
are found. And these then are used in reconstructions.
\subsubsection{Point-wise analysis}
\label{C3.app:A2}

\subsection{Derivation of conversion from the first principles}
\label{C3.app:B}
While \eqref{C3.eq:conv} provides a convenient way to quantify energy transformations, it does 
not have much room for physical interpretation. Such as in complicated situation when along with 
local baroclinic tide production a remote signal is present. The resultant perturbation of bottom 
pressure might lead to rather ambiguous result of internal tide destruction. It is said that such 
regime is to occur when a phase difference between $w_{bt}$ and $p_{1}$ is in range of 
$(\pi/2,~3\pi/2)$. This is understood as an internal tide performing work against barotropic 
forcing. Unfortunately, this statement does not directly follow from \eqref{C3.eq:conv}. Hence, to 
provide cleaner physical picture, let derive the expression for conversion rate from the first 
principles. Body force of \citep{baines1982internal} is performing work by displacing isopycnal 
surfaces 
throughout a water column,
\begin{equation}
\label{C3:eq.convd1}
C(z) = \frac{dW(z)}{dt} = F_{B} w_{bc} = \frac{N^2 (-\vec{u} \cdot \nabla h) z}{i \omega h} 
\frac{d 
\xi}{dt} = \frac{w_{bt}}{i \omega h} \frac{z d(-b)}{dt} = -\frac{1}{h} w_{bt} zb
\end{equation}
where isopycnal displacements $\xi$ were changed to buoyancy, $b = -N^2 \xi$ and temporal 
variation 
was assumed to be harmonic, $\sim e^{i \omega t}$. On a final step, integration by parts can be 
employed as,
\begin{equation}
\label{C3:eq.convd2}
\int_{-h}^{0} z b dz = \int_{-h}^{0} z d \big( \int^0_{z} b dz \big) = \big( z \int^0_{z} b dz 
\big)\big|_{-h}^0 - \int_{-h}^{0} dz \int_{z}^{0} b dz^{\prime} = h (\int_{-h}^{0}b dz - 
\frac{1}{h} \int_{-h}^{0} dz \int_{z}^{0} b dz^{\prime})
\end{equation}
The last expression is a bottom pressure perturbation. Noteworthy, a baroclinicity condition was 
not employed. Combining \eqref{C3:eq.convd1} and \eqref{C3:eq.convd2}, familiar result 
for conversion rate is obtained. Note that a similar approach to \eqref{C3:eq.convd1} was used 
by \citep{nash2006structure} to estimate an upper limit on emitted energy.\\

%Overall, combined discussion of the numerical experiments and field observations suggests that the 
%far field signal is affected both by generation levels at the Macquarie Ridge and mesoscale 
%conditions. The former process mainly factors magnitude of the incident beam, while mesoscale can 
%largely refract beam. The numerical experiments given here were capable to predict gross, 
%time-averaged characteristics of the beam and degree of temporal variability. 
%
%Nevertheless,  This interaction was mainly taken place in February of 
%2015 which corresponds to reorientation 
%Even though the given here result is 
%probably not correct, but from comparison of the simulated wave field 
%
%Another reason for variation is change in the reflected wave. So that increase 
%leads to additional 
%modulation. Even though results are not that trustful in the reflected part, they simple 
%retranslate change in the ratio. So that the first period before day 40 when strong reflected 
%signal was leading to developing strong interference pattern and large deviation from the plane 
%wave value. At the end of that period, decrease in reflected wave was producing more plane wave 
%value. Such variations could be related to changes in beam incidence and reflection at East Tasman 
%Plateau and Tasmania. There is a similar pattern that follows from changes. So more when incidence 
%happens strongly in westward direction, amount of reflected wave is less. And for northward there 
%is more relfective component. The total energy flux orientation in the numerical model does not 
%stand close to the observed.

%distribution of semi major axis of variance ellipse \fignm{C3.fig:fig_12_beam_var_cp}. Here it is 
%clearly seen that primary variations are concentrated in regions downstream that are affected by 
%mesoscale. Additional region is next to the Macquarie Ridge due to generation. But further it is 
%impossible to propagation quite rapidly becomes affected by variable ocean conditions. There are 
%three regions one next to the ridge, than in the basin. And also by the ETP there is strong 
%interaction causing beam to deflect.\\

%These processes are the most important. And 
%refraction seems to be the major player. Refraction is a well-known phenomena in surface gravity 
%waves. In respective theoretical works the directional spectrum plays a pivotal role. Here these 
%approaches are used to diagnose the spectrum. This is carried out by computing two spectral 
%moments,
%\begin{align}
%\label{C3:eq.m.spectra}
%\bar{\theta} = \arctan \frac{\int_{\pi/2}^{\pi} d \theta S \sin \theta}{\int_{\pi/2}^{\pi} 
%d \theta S \cos \theta }\\
%\sigma_\theta = 2\bigg[ 1 - \sqrt{\Big( \frac{\int_{\pi/2}^{\pi} d \theta S \sin 
%\theta}{\int_{\pi/2}^{\pi} d 
%\theta S} \Big)^2 + \Big( \frac{\int_{\pi/2}^{\pi} d \theta S \cos \theta 
%}{\int_{\pi/2}^{\pi} d \theta S}\Big)^2}  \bigg]
%\end{align}
%where $S=S(\theta)$ - directional spectrum at each grid point obtained previously. These moments 
%simply show mean direction in the spectrum and the spreading of waves around the mean. Clearly, if 
%there is any refraction than the mean direction will undergo changes. But the spectrum spreading 
%will also change as close-to-each wavenumbers will experience slightly different adjustments 
%leading either to more spreading as wave group propagates travels into a region with 
%higher phase speeds than surrounding or focusing in the opposite case.\\
%
%Over the field period simulation there was a continuous change in the beam as mesoscale field was 
%evolving. Over the first period, Januaries 10-15, 2015 (Fig), the beam underwent the most striking 
%adjustment. Clearly, some of the waves were refracted equatorward, this portion then interfered 
%with the rest producing a horizontal reorientation of the fluxes. Similar phenomena was observed 
%in 
%numerical experiments of \citep{dunphy2014focusing}. The region is characterized by northward 
%orientation of spectra and high spreading. The waves cross a complex mesoscale field consisting of 
%two closely located eddies. They have signature in the increased eigenspeed and strong currents. 
%Vorticity effects were smaller. Overall, the eigenspeed was locally increased by $~10\%$. This 
%diverted further north already more northward oriented beam.\\
%The further development are shown on Fig. where the fields are given for mid-February, 10th - 
%15th. 
%The previous discussed eddies have merged producing a feature at (155, -46.5). 
%This time it has no effect on the tidal beam. On part because of weak signature in the eigenspeed, 
%but also since the strongest currents are southward and hence, leading to advection in poleward 
%which is seen in the spectrum orientation. Nevertheless, there are two regions that cause some 
%effects. One eddy is located at (158, 48) where again northward refraction happens. Since this a 
%dipole of two oppositely oriented rotating eddies, there are strong gradients in eigenspeed. This 
%produces high spreading in the spectrum. Fluxes again show a localized horizontal reorientataion. 
%Nevertheless, due to small lengthscales this does not have a substantial effect on the beam. 
%Oppositely to the region by ETP (152, -44) here a region with large cross-beam currents, strong 
%imprint in eigenspeed. This leading to diverting portion of the beam northward.\\
%Thence, two major effects were found one when currents are in cross-beam leading to diverting the 
%beam, scattering by mesoscale eddies and refraction.

%The spatial-temporal characteristics complicates direct interpretation of diagnosed energy 
%quantities in describing the tidal beam. Its properties are obscured due to 
%interference and hence, needs additional inferences. This is related to variability. It is unclear 
%what can produce beam's energy levels and its orientation/position. Two reasons could be named as
